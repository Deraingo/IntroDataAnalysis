TA IS HERE TO STAY 








Alongside this week’s store update, we want to congratulate the community on completing the Community Event by achieving 7 MILLION eliminations in Terminal Attack in just one week! If you contributed to the event, be on the lookout for your brand-new community-themed canvas shoes. Nice work, yolks! 
In the past few weeks, we’ve been watching you play Terminal Attack! We are so grateful for your feedback and impressions, and we’ve had a blast watching you attack and defend! Input from the community has been incredibly valuable to us as we work to make this mode a significant and permanent part of THE FINALS. While the event has now ended, and the contracts have expired, we still see so many of you having fun in TA, so we’ve decided to keep it in the game a while longer. 
Don’t forget to keep the feedback coming over on 
Discord
!

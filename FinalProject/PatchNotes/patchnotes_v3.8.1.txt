Performance Update
With update 3.8, we saw a dip in game performance, specifically related to network and bandwidth.
We have just released a hotfix to all platforms that solves this issue. Once you've updated, you should all have a smoother experience across the board with fewer network-related disruptions.
SEE YOU IN THE ARENA!

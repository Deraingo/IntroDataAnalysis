What a whirlwind the last few days have been! Thanks for all the good games and amazing support <3
We have a patch with a few small but impactful updates:
We solved an authentication issue that was incorrectly reported as a ban and removed bans from accounts swept up in the error (try a restart now), an update to Skill-based Matchmaking (SBMM), and an adjustment to alleviate the backfilling annoyances flagged by the community. 
Fixed a Steam login problem that caused players to receive a faulty ban message 
We've made some changes to our skill-based matchmaking to ensure better-quality games. This means matchmaking times are likely to be ever so slightly longer, but you should find yourselves in slightly closer matches
We've updated the way backfills work in Quick Cash and Bank It. This should mean that you get backfilled less often and when you do get backfilled, you should have more time remaining in the match, especially in Bank It mode
We’ve fixed the incorrect timer on the in-game shop
See you in the arena!

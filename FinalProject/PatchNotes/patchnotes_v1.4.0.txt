Merry Patchmas, Yolks!








Today’s patch comes with balance and quality-of-life improvements across the entire game — along with general crash fixes. We also made major changes to our anti-cheat detection to ensure fewer matches with players who don’t play fair. 
To celebrate the holidays, contestants will find a gift waiting for them! And don’t forget to bring your boots to Monaco, because it’s snowy and the halls have been decked! 
Ho-Ho-Ho-Hop in there!

Hotfix 1.2.2 










Feb 2

2023.12.09
Here comes the very first hotfix for THE FINALS.
 




























If you played in our Closed Betas and you feel that you are experiencing the game differently now. Make sure to bump your 
Field-of-View (FOV) up to 90
 in the Video Settings menu for the same experience.
 
UI Changes
Added missing UI that made Oceania/South American matchmaking regions not visible in the settings even though they have been online and working. 
Please note, for the time being, South America will incorrectly be labeled as Brazil.
 
Fixed incorrect UI on prices from Steam that added two additional zeros in some countries. No one was charged that much, it was only a display issue. 
Movement
 Fine-tuned the first-person view sprint animations

Welcome to Update 1.5.5 








Today’s update comes with a number of balance changes for weapons and gadgets, including a decrease in the length of invulnerability after revival. We’ve also implemented crash fixes, and an adjustment to tournament matchmaking that will lead to tighter player skill-gap in tournaments. There is also a fix to the crossplay settings so it can be turned off successfully. 
On top of all of this, we have some new content in the store! 
A note about the future
: based on your feedback and our own telemetry evaluation, we recognize that the 
Recon Senses
 ability for the Medium build needs an overhaul and we’re working on that right now. You can look forward to that change and more in next week’s update!

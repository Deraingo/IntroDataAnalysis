Update 1.3.0










Feb 2

The first patch of Season 1 is chock-full of quality-of-life improvements and general fixes. The one everyone here is most happy about: the doors in Vegas won’t open in the wrong direction anymore — That was 
so
 annoying! 
Here are the highlights we think you will all care about the most:
 
You can now see your actual position in the leaderboards once you have played a ranked match.
Changed requirements for unranked tournaments from 12 to 6 matches
The Recent tab in the social screen is now working
Fixed some crash instances
Animation improvements to movement feel to get closer to the OB experience
Fixed a bug where some doors in Vegas would open in the wrong direction
Hold interactions that are started while moving will no longer be interrupted prematurely
OCE/SA Server Regions are selectable on all platforms

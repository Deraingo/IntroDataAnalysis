Protocol Core, Community Event & Bug Fixes!
Get ready for a brand new community event, the Protocol Core Set, and lock in your aim with the futuristic Mech-Arrow Set! 
Check them out in the brand-new store update:








Today, we’re kicking off the first Community Event of Season 3, and we are challenging you to eliminate 1,900.000 contestants using the weapons and gadgets introduced in Season 3! Join in the race to fill the meter, and everyone who contributes will win the DISSUN Capacitor skin for Dual Blades. 
We’re happy to announce that this update will also happen on Xbox, so the wait is over! With the issue resolved, we want to thank all of our Xbox players for their patience! This interruption in the update schedule was not planned and took far too long to fix. As a thank you for your endurance and as a nod to our own…issues… in this situation, we are gifting all Xbox players the Skill Issue Set. Expect your gift to show up in the next few days!
Certain fixes and server changes intended for this update have been postponed as we prioritized making sure all Contestants got up to speed on the updates, so you can expect more changes to come. But, in order to make sure things are running smoothly, this update will only include: 
Content and Bug Fixes 
Build 
Ensured all platforms are on the same build to re-enable crossplay and content updates for Xbox
Performance
This week we fixed one of the bugs causing players to be stuck in an infinite loading screen
Fixed a bug that caused players to be unable to properly cancel ranked matches

ISEUL-T CUP, Pond Dweller & The Pro Circuit!








Update 3.4 is coming in hot with multiple features and changes fighting over the spotlight! ISEUL-T is entering The Arena as the latest sponsor on the next stop of the World Tour - The ISEUL-T Cup! The Pro Circuit also goes live with this update, however, both of these changes are sharing that spotlight with a certain green someone in our latest store update…
Introducing the Pond Dweller:








Also, we have quite the list of changes this time including several changes to Bank-It, shorter wait-times in Terminal Attack, the addition of party chat while in the main menu and the ability to equip multiple weapon animations to the same gun.
Those of you with a keen eye will also notice that we’ve added an info panel that explains the World Tour’s FINALS event - check it out in-game.
Finally, both Polish and Turkish translations of THE FINALS are now live with this update, so make sure to throw a “Cześć” or “Merhaba” into team chat at the start of a game!
Full list of changes included in this update:
Balance Changes
Gadgets 
Breach Charge
Decreased minimum damage applied at outer edge of explosions to 0
Increased damage radius from 2m to 2.5m
Set damage fall-off to scale linearly from the max damage radius to the outer radius
Dev Note: Previously, our area of effect (AoE) Weapons and Gadgets had several ‘damage shelves’, where damage would fall off radically at the edge of the inner radius of a blast and at the edge of the outer radius. This could result in AoE damage feeling somewhat inconsistent. These changes now cause damage to fall-off linearly from the inner radius damage value, down to 0 at the outer edge of the radius, which we believe will feel much more consistent. The radius of each AoE weapon has been increased slightly as a result of this, as the outer edge of explosions now does much less damage than it did previously. 
 
C4
Decreased minimum damage applied at outer edge of explosions to 0
Increased damage radius from 6m to 6.5m
Set damage fall-off to scale linearly from the max damage radius to the outer radius

Increased damage radius from 4.5m to 5m

Game Modes
Dev Note: These changes are the first part of a series of improvements we’re planning to make to each of our game modes over the course of Season 3, including our Cashout and Power Shift modes. These changes will cover a range of areas, from pacing to scoring. The goal is to smooth out some of the rough edges in each of our modes, hopefully leading to a better overall experience across all our modes.

Decreased respawn time from 17 seconds to 10 seconds

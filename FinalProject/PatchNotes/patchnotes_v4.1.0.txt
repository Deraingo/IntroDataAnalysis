Welcome to the first update of Season 4!
 
Which comes with the first store update:








We’ve got a fix for the dash bug on Light and for the issue with contestant slots causing matchmaking issues! 
Regarding World Tour stops from now on: we’ll start announcing them separately from patch notes, so stay tuned every Thursday for info about the current week’s twist, big or small!
We’re still on track to hand out the Season 3 rewards next week! While you wait, you can join us tonight on the fan-run THE FINALS Reddit for an exclusive AMA with Rob, Gustav (Creative Director), Matt (Design Director), and Joakim (Lead Environmental Artist) with support from Oscar and Dusty! Go submit your burning questions there now and join us live tonight from 18:00-20:00 CEST!
Here are the detailed updates: 
Content and Bug Fixes
Animation 
Fixed an issue where the character mesh would glitch when performing a charged attack with the sword
Performance & Stability
Fixed issue where players could accidentally create more contestant slots than allowed which could lead to problems with matchmaking
Fixed some issues leading to the error messages TFGE0000 and TFGE0008 which could lead to players disconnecting from matches
Fixed an issue which led to players not being able to matchmake into the practice range
Fixed a common Xbox crash

Update 1.5.0

Welcome to Update 1.5








Today we are introducing our very first limited-time mode (LTM): Solo Bank It!
This experimental twist on Bank It pits contestants against each other in a fight for individual glory in a 12-player arena. Just like Bank It, the first to amass 40,000 and deposit in the cash-out station wins. Solo queuers, rejoice! 
We’re putting this mode out there to learn more about your experience, so we’ll open a channel in Discord to gather feedback for as long as the mode stays up. 
Outside the new mode, Update 1.5.0 comes with a litany of balance changes, tweaks, and bug fixes — all laid out below — to help improve the overall experience. 
In addition, with Update 1.5.0 we’re introducing our fair play guidelines, with revamped and improved detection methods for unfair play. From now on, we’ll restrict cheaters with more confidence and will be able to stand firmly behind our bans. Our goal, as always, is to make the game safe, fair, and fun
Finally, we’ve decided to expand the size of our store, with an even bigger and more diverse range of items at any given time.

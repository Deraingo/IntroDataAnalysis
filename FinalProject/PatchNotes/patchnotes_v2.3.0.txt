UPDATES, BALANCE CHANGES AND THE SKILL ISSUE DISCORD QUEST 
We’re excited to announce our very first Discord Quest! You can earn the Skill Issue Set by streaming your gameplay to at least one friend on Discord for 15 minutes. It’s only available on the PC version of Discord, and will work even in a private DM! You can even invite your friend to play with you! 
Check out the outfit below: 








You can also check out our store update:








And finally, the first version of the ranked progression indicator which shows how you move up and down in rank after each ranked tournament has been added! Your feedback continues to be critical on this, so please keep it coming! 
Here are the updates: 
Balancing 
FAMAS
Increased recoil curve recovery delay from 0.68 to 0.8
Increased recoil recovery time from 0.8 to 1
D
ev note: These changes cause automatic recoil recovery to kick in slightly later than before a player finishes firing. It helps prevent an issue where players who pressed the fire button slightly slower than other players felt they saw a very different recoil pattern for the gun
Modes
Power Shift
Added SYS$HORIZON to the map pool 
Enabled a new HUD 
The platform will now deal damage to players that are squished underneath it, to fix the issue where you could be pushed through the ground when trapped  
UI 
Fixed a bug where the revive tab and respawn coins were swapped in the scoreboard
Corrected an issue that made the Career Circuit page appear smaller after viewing rewards on console 
Fixed an issue where Bank Rabbit Bundle couldn’t be purchased via the outfit screen 
Ranked 
Added an end-of-match screen to indicate the change in rank
Added animations to the end-of-match rank screen to show when a player is close to going up or down in rank 
PLEASE  NOTE:
We have a known issue where all players will see the incorrect ranking the first time they boot the game. You can ignore this screen, as it will only show once and will not affect your actual ranking in any way. We decided it was better to go out with this incorrect screen, than to hold off on this feature for another week.

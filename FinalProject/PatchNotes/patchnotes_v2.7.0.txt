SHE’S FINALLY HERE! 








This week, we welcome the long-awaited, community-anticipated Darque Mood outfit. Get your goth on! 
This update has a few performance improvements, UI fixes, and a security update. 
Content and Bug Fixes 
Performance
Fixed an issue where launch options like -dx11 stopped working. However, we still recommend playing without any additional options
Fixed a rare crash on the server 
UI 
Polished the look of the incoming melee damage indicator
Fixed an issue with single item bundle purchase where the wrong item was equipped
Fixed the nametag sometimes intersecting the HUD in terminal attack when in the squad-up screen
Security 
This week, you’ll notice a difference in the number of cheaters in the game. Multiple new rules have been implemented, along with changes to how and when cheaters are detected. These changes mean that cheaters are being detected and removed faster.  
Remember: if you see cheating in the game, report it and add a good comment explaining what is happening. We also collect video reports on 
Discord
, so if you capture suspicious behavior, send it in!

COMMUNITY CHALLENGE COMPLETE! 








Today, we’re bringing you an update with some balance changes and dev comments on future changes to both the Stun Gun and the Cloaking Device! 
The second Community Challenge has come to an end. Congratulations on reaching the goal! We were never worried (maybe a little worried), enjoy your brand new Boombox — and special shout out to contestant “Goo and Sledge” for pushing the platform an astounding 185km!
Also, you may have noticed that we have switched to using Embark ID as our main Display name in-game. You can change your Embark ID display name by visiting the 
Embark Portal
. 
Now! Let’s get into the changes included in Update 2.5.0:
Balance Changes 
Gadgets
Data Reshaper
Range increased from 5m to 15m
Target FOV decreased from 25 degrees to 12 degrees
Dev note: to account for the increased range.
Stun Gun
Dev Note: We’re aware of player frustrations around being stunned by the Stun Gun and are planning some changes to get it to a better place. However, these changes require more testing before we deploy them so it will be update 2.6 before these arrive. 
Specializations
Cloaking Device
Increased the activation cost from 14.2% to 33%. 
Dev Note: This does not change the maximum sustain time, but makes it drain faster when toggling it on and off too frequently.
 
In addition to this change, we’re also investigating changes to the visibility of cloaked players, but these will not be deployed until the 2.6 update as they require more testing.
Mesh Shield
Decreased health from 1000 to 750
Weapons
KS-23
Bullet dispersion reduced when jumping, sprinting, or zoomed in, to make the weapon more accurate
Security 
AFK/Idle rule enhancements
Added detections for software such as cheat tools and injectors, leading to suspensions

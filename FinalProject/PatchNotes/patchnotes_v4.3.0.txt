Store Update, Season 3 Rewards and Final Day for the Community Event
Let’s get ready to muck up the competition with the Green Gunk Set, or maybe climb your way to the top using the Mean Green Beanstalk Set - both featured in this week’s store update:








Season 3 Ranked Rewards
Following today’s update we will be sending out the missing Multibucks from the Season 3 World Tour. If you made it to Bronze 4 last season, 50 Multibucks will be coming your way shortly - and - if you made it all the way to Gold 1 you can expect 250 Multibucks to find its way to your account.
Alongside the Multibucks, we will also be publishing one final Ranked leaderboard for Season 3, and with it, also hand out the last few rewards which were missing from that leaderboard as well.
Community Event Update
The current Community Event is making good progress, but it’s not been completed yet! Less than 24 hours remain and there’s still a way to go. Make sure to equip any of the Season 4 weapons and head into The Arena! If the community makes it you’ll all receive the ENGIMO community-compliant .50 Akimbo’s!
Check the current progress on our leaderboard right here: https://id.embark.games/leaderboards/ce42

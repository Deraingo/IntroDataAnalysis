Check out the store update for this week: 








THE FINALS is best with friends, and to aid you in your quest to build the ultimate team, this week we are introducing the refer-a-friend program! Head on over to Embark ID to get your unique URL that can be shared with friends who have yet to play THE FINALS. 
Once your invited friend has played 20 rounds of the game, you’ll both get 100 Multibucks! Get rewarded for up to five friends and check out the full rules over on Embark ID. 
Want one more way to recruit your friends? What better way is there than to wear THE FINALS merch in public? Today we’re also launching our merchandise store where you can pick up some THE FINALS or OSPUZE-related merch, oh, and there’s stickers! With some of the items, you can get an in-game copy of your IRL drip! This is our first run, so supplies are limited! The shop will drop in a few hours, and you can watch the countdown in the meantime:

Finally, this week we have a new community challenge! Collectively cash out $100 billion in World Tour Cashout and earn the DISSUN Interrupter helmet from our generous World Tour sponsor! Only those who contribute to this eye-popping goal will get the reward, so make sure to do your part!

UI 
Fixed a bug where the “THE FINALS” leaderboard was incorrectly counting wins from other game modes, in addition to Tournament wins

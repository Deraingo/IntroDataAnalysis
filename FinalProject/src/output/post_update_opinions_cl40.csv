The Finals Season 4,RAVyAwBl32Q,Is The Finals Being Gatekept? (Season 4),in today's video I kind of want to go a little off the cuff I'm not going to add any infographics no fancy editing just me talking to you about some thoughts bouncing up here in my Noggin I've seen more than enough posts on Reddit as well as comments on my YouTube videos saying the same things as to why this game is not doing as well as it should reasons such as having subpar quality the balancing sucks too many cheaters and monetization is horrible when the reality of it is some of these statements are far from the truth and the rest are problems that every FP s has to an even higher degree the quality of this game in my opinion is in a league of its own with a team that is significantly smaller than that of a major AAA Studio the balancing is always being modified because they are actually listening to the players regardless if the suggestions are good or bad now they might not give you exactly what you want as an individual but the fact is they're listening to what the majority of the player base want and saying that they don't listen at all is a grossly false statement at the least as for cheaters please tell me what game is completely free of them while you're at it please tell me what game you can manly report them to Discord where a person can actually take a look at the evidence I'll wait because I don't know if it's just me but whenever I've reported a cheater in game three out of five times I would get a confirmation within the next week that they've been banned now if you are an ordinary player that reports someone in Apex Legends good luck because you're more than likely going to see that player in the top 700 at the end of the season facing no repercussions whatsoever and hell in war zone you could even make a career out of cheating in fact the finals has taken the first steps to combat software such as rewas to which other games had to take notice and start following suit I can go on and on about this topic but trust me the grass is not greener on the other side believe that and as for monetization the prices are not only fair but they even allow you to buy particular items from a bundle that you want rather than the entire bundle itself and for this current Halloween event you have the opportunity to get 27 free rewards and these rewards are not just stickers or charms some are actually quality skins whether or not the player is actually able to obtain them all is a different story but still the fact of the matter is there is a ways and means of potentially receiving them for free in contrast to apex's collection event which gives you a charm sticker or depending on how much they've pissed off the player base maybe even a skin now that we have a little perspective it is in my opinion that these are not the reasons why the finals is not doing as well as it should it is simply because players don't want to throw away the skill acquired from the game they are currently playing just to start all over again from scratch with something new even if that new game is Superior in every single aspect the majority of players just don't want to throw away that time invested this is particularly because of the increasingly competitive culture we live in today where everyone wants to be a well-known streamer or the best esport athlete known to man to sweat their balls off with the best of them and playing the game is for potential monetization rather than just for the fun of it this is blatantly clear with the abundance of TTV or kick names that you see in every other match no offense to anyone that does stream but this is just the reality of things because in order for this game to really find huge success is for one of the big four to fail which is Apex fortnite Call of Duty or OverWatch I know there are a lot of other huge titles but these are the most similar in terms of gameplay to the finals my point being is that Embark needs to play a game of patrici by making sure that the finals is in a great state so that when not if one of these big four fail the finals will be ready to receive a huge chunk of the players in the power vacuum the game Left Behind allowing it to finally achieve the recognition it deserves now failing can come in many ways not just by low player population it can also come in the way of people just having enough enough of their money time and effort being taken advantage of and when that time comes the finals will be waiting for them with open arms so if you're a player that's sitting on the fence thinking to yourself I don't know if I want to give this game a solid chance because I've invested way too much time in a particular game I want you to remember this because it took me a while to realize it as well that the fundamentals of aim such as Target acquisition click timing and tracking are consistent throughout all these major titles some may heavily rely on one aspect than the others but in general if you have solid fundamentals of aim you can easily transfer skill from one game to another this is why players like shroud or ASU can hop on to almost any FPS and quickly be proficient at it because they're able to use their fundamentals to find similarities of skill to transfer from one game to another anyhow I'm starting to feel like I'm going on a tangent here and I don't want to keep rambling on but yeah what are your thoughts is it because of bigger games gatekeeping the finals or is it because of other factors that is preventing this game from reaching its true potential I love to hear from you but again keep it civil if you enjoyed this video please drop a like And subscribe for all things to fin us the rest of the video is just going to be game play so peace and love guys and I'll see you in the [Music]

The Finals Season 4,ef_7iYeNR_k,I tried and ranked EVERY gadget in The Finals SEASON 4,season 4 made some pretty big changes to some of the gadgets for every class and for today's video I used every single one of them and ranked them from D tier to S tier in my opinion of course there's time stamps for those of you who just want to look for a specific Gadget or see the whole list and with that let's begin the frag grenade has become a staple of my and many other players loadouts recently and for good reason the damage that these things can do is really good and you get two of them and because there's no grenade indicator in the finals these things can really catch a lot of players off guard this is a solid atier pick smoke grenade is a bit of a niche pick but that doesn't mean that it's useless it can put out fires keeps Zer grenades from detecting you and can help you steal cash outs unfortunately that's pretty much where its usage ends it might be more powerful if more people used fire-based gadgets but you don't really see them too often hopefully these things get a buff in the future cuz I'd honestly think it would be a really interesting meta but there's usually better options to pick for your team putting it in the C tier flashbang got some big changes this season that really made it a lot more usable now it will only give you the hit indicators if you fully blind someone and the blind now lasts for longer making these things actually decent well I think some of the other Gadgets in this list provide more value for your team they are not nearly as bad as they used to be landing them in the B tier gas grenade is in a bit of a weird spot right now it's decent for delaying a cash out or doing crowd control damage but it's sometimes a little hard to capitalize off it and some players can also just heal through the damage I'd say it's a niche c-tier pick and maybe if you got two gas grenades or the duration was increased you might see more people using it in the higher level lobbies ponade is also unfortunately another Niche Gadget it can clear out gas and slowly destroy goo which can be helpful and the ability for it to damage through walls and ceilings is also pretty cool but that's where the usefulness ends its damage isn't especially great and the utility it provides is outdone by the thermal board if they increased the damage or gave it an extra charge or two I could maybe see this being used a little bit more but for now it has to go into the C tier go grenade has honestly become a bit of a meta option and I'm really excited about that while it's countered by charging slam and dematerializer its stall potential is honestly really good and I've been seeing a lot of people find great success with it and its ability to create new climbing Pathways trap enemies in rooms or create whole new angles is really valuable Landing it in the a tier explosive mine used to be pretty decent but after the Nerfs to it at the beginning of the season it's really not that great anymore two mines can't even kill a medium and they require way more preparation and luck than something like the frag grenades and while you can drop them on someone taking a cash out with dmat it's a bit of a gimmicky strategy rather than something that is actually viable in most circumstances and in my experience this opportunity rarely comes I put them in the C tier gas mine is a pretty decent method to create area denial and it can be pretty good in some of the lower levels of the game but it's at the higher levels where it starts to fall off as most teams at these levels will opt to just kill the defending team instead of trying to steal midf fight making the gas mines nowhere near as useful I plac them in B tier because they're still decent for most players but their efficacy will really depend on who you're facing even though it was nerfed the RPG is still one of the best gadgets that a heavy can bring it can open or close engagements very easily and it's a great I need this wall broken this second button in gencies it goes into the S tier since RPG got nerfed this is probably the best gadget in Heavy's Arsenal the ability to basically give your team free HP to play around in a matter of seconds is really important and while you have to be more intentional with your use of it now it's still a fantastic Gadget that goes into the S tier motion sensor is a decent Gadget especially for solo queue but in a team setting there's often better gadgets available for you to use getting alerted to where players are is helpful but it can't really be used offensively like the tracking darts or the sonar grenade which is really where it tends to not do as well it's still decent and a pretty good pick for solo key players and I'd place it in the B tier as it's definitely a situational but still pretty good Gadget with the Nerf to explosive mines pyrro mine has taken the top spot for the best landmines in my opinion they do solid enough damage and I often like to put them on statues to at least somewhat punish defibs you also get to start with two which is more than what you can say for the explosive of Minds at the moment I plac them in the B tier despite its many Nerfs that it has received over time the C4 remains a staple pick for the heavy Loadout and this is mainly for one particular reason to delay the cash out remotely so you can afford to play further away almost every top player you ask is going to say that this is a must pick for the heavy class and having the C4 ready to drop a cash out really can be a GameChanger just make sure you knock over the cash out on top of it so that nobody can shoot or glitch it I'm going to put it in the a tier the anti-grab cube is a bit of an unfortunate Gadget it's not really good at anything except for being able to move cash outs around in combination with the winch claw it can also technically stall a cash out but this can be pretty easily countered by a heavy using mes Shield or you can just shoot the cube i' place it in the C tier barricade has fallen off a little bit as of late but it's still pretty decent a lot more teams are opting for goo lately as they cover a lot more distance and can't be dematerialized the barricade does tend to be able to be maneuvered around a little bit more easily in combat situations it's an okay pick that will go into the B tier jump pad has remained one of the most popular picks for the medium class for good reason being able to give your team free height and Escape Route or just movement in general is not only fun but also extremely valuable not to mention these silly things you can do with it like bouncing cash outs easily an S tier Gadget another very useful Gadget similar to the jump pad the zipline has longer range and can help you get to locations quickly but it is a little easier to shoot people on it so do be aware of that it's even better when you combine it with the jump pad to get some insane movement it can also be considered an stier option one of the most powerful things in a game that focuses on abilities and utility is taking away those things and the glitch trap does just that it's also a good counter to the triple medium defib chains that have become much more common recently making it an a tier Gadget data reshaper is one of those gadgets that will either be super helpful or borderline useless depending on the team that you're facing turning turrets into harmless potted plants will always be funny being able to cycle through different arena carbles is also a little bit underrated but if the enemy teams aren't running anything that can be reshaped this ends up being mostly a wasted perk slot I'd place it in the B tier for this season okay let's be honest here for a second even someone with two hours in the game will probably figure out very quickly that defib is probably the most powerful Gadget in the game right now being able to revive a player basically for free at a bit of an HP cost is super helpful and it's hard to counter these things unless you completely decimate the enemy team or actively dedicate Gadget slots to counter it such as with the glitch trap easily one of the best if not the best gadget in the game right now is going into the S tier APS is kind of similar to the data reshaper in that it is something that is very dependent on the other team's Loadout if nobody is running throwable utility or grenade launchers the aps is pretty much useless however that's not going to happen very often because so many things in this game are throwables and because things like RPG frag grenade and glitch grenade are so popular this thing is going to go into the a tier Gateway is legitimately one of the best pieces of utility in the current state of the game and is something that I almost never take off of the light you can use it to get cash outs quickly and to just improve your pacing in general and it's also very good at allowing your team to defend your cash out much further away than you normally would be able to it is also a really good method to allow your team to push up on opponents without taking any damage which is super helpful in the current Pike meta because Gateway is so good in so many different situations it's going into the S tier glitch grenades is one of those gadgets that is much more valuable in higher level play and a little underwhelming in the lower level lobbies remember how earlier I talked about how good defib and Dome Shield are well this gadget is the counter to those gadgets this thing is super powerful with a coordinated team and I'm going to put it in the a tier stun gun is a gadget that is very good in all skill levels of play but mainly for different reasons in lower ELO being able to drastically reduce your targets movement speed basically to a standstill is really good but if you're not careful a medium or a heavy with good aim and reaction time can still win that DPS battle the part that I personally find the most important in the stun gun is actually the ability to deny specializations and to stop a Cash Out Steel which are all really helpful especially against mes Shield users or heal beam users I'd place this gadget at the top of a tier thermal vision is still in my opinion one of the worst specializations in the game and look I understand using it if you have trouble tracking targets and you use it for accessibility reasons but besides this it's ridiculously Niche and even comes with some drawbacks you can't see mines or gas while it's active which is really a huge oversight in my opinion and the niche strategy of being able to see through smoke and see other invisible lights is really not that great especially when there's other gadgets you could be using that help your team far more I'd place it in the D tier hopefully this thing gets buffed at some point I'd really like for it to be good but it just isn't right now thermal bore is a rarely used but pretty valuable gadget for light it allows you to make openings in walls destroy goo and even get rid of gas and this is all in one Gadget which is honestly really helpful I'd place it in the beer vanish bomb is super helpful for lights on Dash or on grapple who use close- range weapons and need a Quick Escape or a way to sneak up on someone it can really throw people off when the light who was just using cloak earlier now can Dash and being able to cloak your other team members is also really helpful I'd place it in the a tier with the buff to breaching charges allowing you to now hold three at a time you'll basically always have something to destroy a wall with when using this gadget it's great at delaying cash outs like the C4 as well so if your heavy isn't running that you could sort of do that job yourself combine this with the gateway to allow yourself to play a fair ways away from the cash out it's going into the a tier tracking Dart got some much needed changes this season that I think made it a lot more viable having four darts instead of two can give you pretty good uptime on entire enemy teams but it can be a little bit more Niche than the sonar grenade it's an absolutely horrible thing to be hit by this as a light player but it's not that big of a deal if you're playing something like a mes Shield heavy it's still a pretty decent pick either way and I'd place it as a solid B tier option and finally Sona grenade it has its bandages over the tracking Dart mainly because it has the potential to Ping a lot more players and you don't have to be able to see them this alone is often the info that you need and it makes the gadget pretty good in my opinion especially when fights start to get super chaotic I place this in B tier in general but I could see switching off this to use tracking Dart in the final round or if you just have a different kind of play style and that finishes up this list here's everything on it and if you skip to the end just feel free to pause the video here and take a look at it for a minute consider subscribing to the channel for mostly weekly finals videos and I'll see you next time,"The reviewer has ranked various gadgets in the game 'The Finals' from D tier to S tier. The frag grenade is highly rated, falling into the A tier because of its high damage output and the ability to catch other players off guard due to the absence of a grenade indicator in the game. The smoke grenade, however, is considered a niche pick and is placed in the C tier; it has limited uses, though it can put out fires and prevent detection by Zer grenades. The reviewer hopes for a buff to make it more viable in the meta. 

The flashbang, which has seen significant changes in season 4, is now considered decent and lands in the B tier. The improvements include longer blinding effects and hit indicators only appearing when a player is fully blinded. 

The gas grenade is also in the C tier, as it's useful for delaying a cash out or controlling crowds, but it's hard to utilize effectively, and some players can heal through the damage. The reviewer suggests that having two gas grenades or increasing the duration might make it more popular in higher-level lobbies. 

The ponade is mentioned but the opinion is cut off.

Unfortunately, the reviewer did not provide specific feedback or opinions on the cl40 or its performance after the 4.2.0 update. The commentary provides a mixed review of the CL40 weapon after the 4.2.0 update in 'The Finals'. The reviewer compliments the CL40's unique capabilities including its ability to destroy goo and damage through walls and ceilings. However, the reviewer also criticizes the weapon's damage output and lack of versatility compared to alternatives such as the thermal board. Suggestions for improvement include increasing the weapon's damage or providing additional charges. 

The reviewer also mentions other weapons, such as the go grenade, which has become a meta option due to its stall potential and ability to create new climbing pathways and trap enemies. The explosive mine, however, is critiqued for its decreased effectiveness after the recent nerfs, requiring more preparation and luck compared to other weapons such as frag grenades. 

The gas mine is seen as a decent method for area denial, particularly effective in lower levels of the game. However, its usefulness decreases in higher levels, where most teams would rather eliminate the defending team than steal mid-fight.

Despite being nerfed, the RPG is still considered one of the best gadgets for a heavy, with the ability to open or close engagements easily and act as a fast solution to break walls. 

Overall, the opinions on the CL40 and other weapons in 'The Finals' indicate a need for balance adjustments to ensure fair gameplay and improve player satisfaction. The opinions on the weapon balancing in the game 'The Finals' after the 4.2.0 update seem mixed, with some weapons being praised and others being criticized. The RPG, which was deemed an important gadget in the Heavy's Arsenal, was nerfed in the update and now requires more intentional use. While it was considered a fantastic gadget previously, it is still in the S tier despite the nerf. 

The motion sensor, while decent especially for solo queue, was criticized for not being as effective in a team setting due to better gadgets available. It was considered situational but still good, and was placed in the B tier. 

The pyrro mine, despite the nerf to explosive mines, is considered the best landmine due to its solid damage and the ability to start with two, and is placed in the B tier. 

The C4, despite its many nerfs over time, remains a staple pick for the heavy Loadout due to its ability to delay the cash out remotely. It is considered a must pick by top players and is placed in the A tier. 

The anti-grab cube was considered an unfortunate gadget due to its limited utility, and was placed in the C tier. 

The barricade was criticized for having fallen off a bit, but no specific tier placement was given. 

As for the cl40, there are no specific opinions or comments about this weapon in the provided text. More information would be needed to provide an opinion on The opinions about weapon balancing and the performance of the cl40 after the 4.2.0 update for the game 'The Finals' seem to cover a range of gadgets and abilities. 

The goo is now favored by more teams due to its ability to cover more ground and its immunity to dematerialization. However, the barricade is considered less effective as it can be maneuvered around easily in combat, making it a B tier choice.

The jump pad remains a top choice for the medium class, providing a strategic advantage in terms of movement and escape options. It also allows for some creative gameplay like bouncing cash outs, making it an S tier choice.

The zipline is another valuable gadget for quick movement and reaching locations faster. Despite being easier targets while using it, its potential when combined with the jump pad makes it an S tier option as well.

The glitch trap is useful for countering abilities and utility, particularly against the increasingly common triple medium defib chains, making it an A tier gadget.

The data reshaper's effectiveness depends on the opposing team's setup. It can turn turrets into harmless entities and cycle through different arena carbles, but if the enemy team doesn't have anything that can be reshaped, it's considered a waste, placing it in the B tier.

Defib is seen as the most powerful gadget in the game due to its ability to revive a player at a small HP cost, making it very difficult to counter unless the enemy team is completely wiped After the 4.2.0 update for the game 'The Finals', the general consensus is that the cl40 has been performing well, particularly in combination with select gadgets. 

The glitch trap is praised as one of the best gadgets in the game, potentially even the best, and is highly recommended for S tier. The APS, similar to the data reshaper, is said to be very dependent on the other team's loadout, but as throwable utilities and grenade launchers are popular, the APS is usually valuable and thus ranked in the A tier.

The Gateway is considered one of the best pieces of utility in the game's current state. It is praised for improving pacing, enabling quick cash outs, and allowing teams to defend their cash out from a safer distance. It's also recognized as an effective method for teams to advance on opponents without taking damage. Due to its versatility, the Gateway is placed in the S tier.

Glitch grenades are seen as more valuable in higher level play and a bit underwhelming in lower level lobbies. They're powerful with a coordinated team and are ranked in the A tier.

The stun gun is regarded as a valuable gadget in all skill levels, with its ability to drastically reduce a target's movement speed being particularly useful. However, the stun gun requires careful use, as medium or heavy opponents with good aim and quick reaction times can still win a DPS battle. The stun gun's ability to deny specializations and stop a Cash Out is seen as The cl40 in 'The Finals' game has varying opinions post the 4.2.0 update. Some users find it incredibly useful against Shield users or Heal Beam users, placing the gadget at the top of a tier. They believe that it's a valuable gadget for the light class as it allows you to create openings in walls, destroy goo, and get rid of gas. This all-in-one feature is seen as very helpful. 

However, some opinions on the cl40 are not as favorable. There are criticisms about the thermal vision specialization, which some players find to be one of the worst in the game. They argue that it's too niche and comes with drawbacks, such as the inability to see mines or gas while it's active. The strategy of being able to see through smoke and other invisible lights is not seen as very useful, especially when compared to other gadgets that could potentially benefit the team more. 

The Vanish Bomb is seen as very helpful for lights on Dash or on Grapple who use close-range weapons. This gadget provides a quick escape or a way to sneak up on someone. It's also seen as beneficial for cloaking other team members. With the buff to breaching charges, players now have the ability to hold three at a time, which is seen as a great tool for delaying cash outs like the C4. 

The Tracking Dart also received some changes this season that are seen as a significant improvement. Now, with four darts instead of two The player's opinions on the weapon balancing for the cl40 in 'The Finals' after the 4.2.0 update seem to be mixed to positive. They feel that it has become more niche and performs differently based on the type of player character. They mention that it's a horrible weapon to be hit by if you're a light player, implying that it has significant impact or damage against such characters. On the other hand, it doesn't pose much of a problem for characters like mes Shield heavy, indicating that it might not be as effective against heavier or more armored characters.

However, the player still considers it a pretty decent pick, placing it in the B tier category. They feel that the cl40 offers versatility in the game, being a suitable choice in most situations, and could be a strategic choice based on the player's style and game progression.

They also mention about the sonar grenade and tracking dart, stating that these have their own advantages. Particularly, the sonar grenade is appreciated for its ability to ping multiple players even without visual contact, which is especially useful when fights get chaotic. They rank the sonar grenade similarly in the B tier, but suggest that players might switch it with the tracking dart in the final round or based on their play style.

In summary, the player seems satisfied with the weapon balancing after the update, recognizing the strategic role of each weapon and offering players a range of options to suit their game style and situation. They recommend subscribing to the channel"
The Finals medium class,PaSJNoNkh60,How to be the Medium Player that your teammates will love,so you want to play the medium class maybe it's because you saw how some of the top players play medium and decided that you want to take your gameplay to that level or maybe you've gotten addicted to the movement that the zip line and the jump pad provide you or maybe you just saw the AK-47 and decided yep yep this is this is the class it's been decided whatever the case may be you've come to the right place with this video I'll be giving you all the information that you need so that you can stop your gaml from looking like this here let me get this defib off real quick jump pad there's a guy turret out you're done for it buddy there's two what the what that there's two of them that's not that's not fair as a medium you are playing one of the most versatile classes in the game you're good on attack defense and support but with these advantages comes a large skill Gap that you need to be aware of when you pick this character so to help you climb that skill Gap I'm going to be providing a bunch of tips for every medium specialization throughout this video as well as tips for medium class as a whole and with all that being said let's get started so the very first thing that I'm going to do here is put down this jump pad for my team right here which allows me and in particular my heavy teammate to get very aggressive with the Enemy team I noticed that my Heavy's health bar is getting kind of low and at this time I take a ton of damage so I reposition and heal my heavy so he can take the fight instead I'm also going to do a quick defp on the heavy teammate which is just going to give us a lot more certainty in being able to close out this fight but something that I've noticed is that there there are a lot of people who use defibs at really bad times so I'm going to quickly explain when you should defib and when you should not this is when it's okay to defib if you can gain numbers advantage on the enemy team or at least equal out your team numbers to stall a cash out and divert attention in emergencies and to quickly reset if you expect a third party but there are many times when you should not defib some of these are if someone is already resing if you are unlikely to win the fight even with the defib an instance of this would be if you are in a 1v3 and everybody is at half or more Health if you have to die for the res in some cases this one is okay but 95% of the time dying to get a defib off is a really bad idea and if you are in no danger and you can save it for later treat your defib like a valuable commodity do not waste it so now that I've discussed when you should and shouldn't defib let's go back to the gameplay examples after we've secured this cashbox it's time to put our movement to use again taking height is very important in this game because if you don't have someone else will and medium's utility lets you get that height Advantage very fast I heard some enemy footsteps so I decided to Ping wildly to let my team no to group up if you are playing solo queue and something important like this is happening please use your ping Button as it can really be the difference between you winning that fight and you losing that [Applause] fight one contestant doesn't seem now some of you may have noticed that we are leaving this cash out before it's completed we are doing this because this cash out is honestly almost done and it's highly unlikely that a team steals during this time and before this I had checked the scoreboard and I had seen that all of the teams were actually doing damage which means that they are all fighting over the cash out more than likely however this is where I almost make a crucial mistake not playing with my team it's important to play buyer team when you are a medium or a heavy but especially as a heal beam when I realize my mistake I immediately go to regroup with my heavy who can hopefully protect me my heavy decided to dome shield in and go for the cash out but instead of healing him the whole time like a lot of mediums would I Instead try to kill the people shooting at him there's a time into place for healing but if you can outright kill an opponent it's better to do that instead of just healing King them and hoping that they survive after I deposited this cash out I noticed that D already has a fair bit of progress on it and it's close by that means there's the potential for us to be able to take both cash outs and if we could pull that off that would be a huge Advantage but before I push in I try to get some opening damage from long range and wait for my heavy to push in ahead of me when you're the healbe medum you want to try to be the Last One Alive as often as possible as he takes the cash out I'm going to watch to make sure that nobody tries to kill him while he takes it once again this medium shows up near the end of the Steal but because the cash out is nearly stolen I go to heal instead of kill after I whiff some really easy shots here I go to defib the heavy in case of a third party now here is a very important decision making moment when I go over to push up on this cash box I notice that the timer is nearly up and both of my teammates are busy fighting so if we want to take this box I have to act now luckily my teammates were able to body block for me and we were able to take it so while you as a heal beam medium probably shouldn't be the one taking the cash box in certain Niche scenarios like this you just might have to do it anyways also if this video has been helpful consider leaving it a like as it really does help me out a ton and if you like the sound of mostly weekly finals videos consider subscribing it's okay I can wait okay I'm done now let's get back to the video in this game I'm in a triple medium team and I'm playing with dematerializer with dmat you can afford to play a little bit more aggressively and a little bit more like a light player because you don't have to worry about healing your teammates so I'm going to be pretty front and center in a lot of these fights I see that the heavy has put up a barricade and is playing behind it so I decide to pressure him with the dmat my teammate manages to take down the heavy but then goes down but instead of getting the defibr I leave that to the other more support focused medium in my team and try to go and finish off the light once again I'm going to give my team a little bit of movement so we can deposit the cash box faster and then we're going to to take height it's actually a much better idea to not hold the cash boox on the moving platform but instead to follow it around from High Ground if you get this specific event instead of chasing this team across and trying to kill them we are going to take this zip line all the way to the top of Apartments where we will be able to hold a much better position and can use our movement gadgets to quickly rotate to the platform if necessary if this team doesn't want to get jump padded on top of they're going to have to challenge us while we have the positioning Advantage at this point I go into get aggressive with my dmat and get their attention and some opening damage but then I rotate out with my jump pad and let my teammates clean up after we finish this fight we're going to use the zipline to once again rotate over to the next building and be ready for another fight if necessary and sure enough pink team is going for the Cash Out station so I decide to drop down and keep them from stealing the cash out even if it means that I end up dying I managed to stop them from stealing with my aggressive play and while they are focused on dealing with me my teammates are able to get some pretty free damage on so this next engagement is a really good example of how you should play dmat around cash out a lot of dmat players would like to drop the cash out immediately upon depositing the cash box but this isn't a great idea here I'm going to hold the high ground with the rest of my team to try and stop the enemy before they even reach the cash out here by playing below the cash out instead of above it I can drop it down and stall for longer and possibly isolate A3 V1 if I also manage to get one of the opponents then me and my team are going to rotate to the floor below again to do the exact same thing here pink team finds us and takes a fight but because we aren't playing in the room with the cash boox we are limiting our chances of being attacked by a third party after I whiff some of my shots I go and defit my teammate instead of slow resing because I hear footsteps and I expect that I will need to drop the cash out immediately some other ways that you can use the dmat is by playing very aggressively with it and cutting off opponents who might be running away from you [Music] at the time of recording this video turret is easily the worst specialization you can use for medium unless you play terminal attack however if you still want to use it I do have a few tips for you on how you can maximize your turret efficiency be careful about some of the materials that you place your turrets on for instance these ceilings on Soul tend to break really e easily and if your turret falls down from them it's pretty much useless a lot of players expect you to place your turrets near the cash out but if you do this too much it can become predictable and your turrets lose a lot of their value FX it up once in a while by placing it in an area away from the cash out where you can either fall back to or play from to catch the Enemy by surprise another example of good turret placement is this clip right here where I placed it in a space that will cover either staircase from the enemy that they could push up from Once the turret does some opening damage I Engage The Enemy while they are distracted to get a quick kill I also tend to notice a lot of turret medium players like to sit by their turret at all times you don't need to do this and this actually limits you a lot don't be afraid to push enemies and then when they chase you go run back to where your turret is placed to make them really choose between whether they want to keep pushing you or if they want to back up and not deal with that turret something else that I do to mix things up as well is placing my turret in one area for the first fight at a cash out and then moving it after that fight is finished to be much closer to the cash out this usually really catches my opponents off guard and can be a great way to mix up your strategy but besides these tips just play turret medium in a similar way to the dematerialize your medium and you should be fine and those are a bunch of ways that you can be a better medium player now all of these things can be quite a lot to take in so if you feel overwhelmed by all this information just try focusing on one thing at a time until you've mastered that and then move on to the next thing I really hope that this video was helpful and entertaining and if it was consider giving it a like as it really does help out the channel and consider subscribing for mostly weekly videos on the finals and with that I'll see you in the next one [Music],"The player seems to be discussing the medium class in the game 'The Finals' after

The need for specific feedback on the cl40 and the 4.2.0 update remains unaddressed in this review. The review talks about different strategies for playing 'The Finals' after the 4.2.0 update. However, there isn't specific mention of the cl40 weapon. The review does mention the use of a turret, stating that it is currently the worst specialization for medium unless the player is in terminal attack mode. The player suggests varying turret placement and not relying on it too much, since it can become predictable and lose value. The reviewer also advises against constantly staying by the turret as this can limit the player's actions. The reviewer further suggests using aggressive play to cut off opponents who might be running away. No specific comments about weapon balancing were provided. The text doesn't provide specific opinions or feedback on the CL40 weapon or its performance after the 4.2.0 update in 'The Finals'.

The Finals medium class,81CpaQSUMG8,How to Win More with Medium Class – The Finals Pro Tips,medium is the most used Class in the finals right now I think and after close to 650 hours in the game I want to share the things I've learned Ming medium and high level lobbies but before you jump in the arena make sure you know what you're up against one of the things I like to do is check the leaderboard before getting into the game this way I know which classes I'm up against and I can choose my counter weapons and gadgets if I see a lot of lights in my Lobby for example I'll choose between the F card the revolver or the model 1887 because I counter best lights with those weapons one of the most interesting things I found about this game is how Embark managed to make the medium a support class while also acting as an assault class you can do just as much damage if not more than a heavy or light while still supporting your team more than they can this brings me to the heal beam I've seen a lot less medium players use the heal beam after their season 4 Nerf but it's still an extremely powerful tool for the medium class I'm sure we've all been against a three medium heal beam circle jerk before I'm back circle jerk circle jerk circle jerk circle jerk circle jerk but remember you don't always have to be aggressive as medium you can hang back with the heal beam and watch the show I'm healing you bro I'm healing you bro I'm healing you bro it's all you bro nice another thing you can do with the heal beam is the body block heal Strat that I'm sure you've all encountered before which is also really good for the last second steals but hey if you're not a heal beam guy that's okay with me you have to find the best specializations and gadgets that fit your play style I personally like to stay alive as long as I can so I've been using a lot of things to keep me alive like the goo grenade and dematerializer as of recent Staying Alive while dealing damage to your opponents helps your team a lot because even if you can't finish someone off on your own your team is there to help you and if one of your teammates go down you can defib someone and keep them alive speaking of staying alive make sure you're using your movement and gadgets to outplay your opponents this is especially useful when fighting in buildings cuz the enemies never expect a window jump when I'm being chased utilize your gadgets use Goo or grenades or flashbangs whatever you need to help stay alive this kind of goes for every class but let's say you aren't running the right gadgets or you ran out well using the canisters around the map is extremely underrated I've gotten out of so many situations where I should have died but a trusty goo canister or red canister was there to save my life when I should have very easily died for all you AR users make sure you learn The Recoil pattern of your gun with that said I don't even fully know the recoil pattern of every gun I have the memory of a goldfish but I do remember the F car pattern because all the bullets do is go up to the right slightly this one was very easy to learn for me and with the season 4 update allowing me to remove the scope the F car has become a lot more satisfying to use so before jumping into a game check out the patterns in the practice range or do what I do and just shoot a wall when you join a game for a quick reminder of The Recoil pattern remember that Medium is a support class so if you're the type of player that likes defending cash outs then don't be sleeping on the mines sometimes you can get away with some pretty ridiculous things a man uh on that the will have to oh my God oh my oh my no [ __ ] way dude that's wild that is insane the glitch mine is still very powerful despite its season 4 Nerf you only get one but you can place two on the map once it's done charging up throwing a glitch mine on a statue is a great counter to other mediums and it's one of the most frustrating things they can encounter going for a defib on your teammate and being glitched and switched to your primary weapon is not a good time team coordination is huge in this game and I I get it solo cubing is tough but try to find someone you played well with and AD them having your team all push someone is easily one of the best ways to win and having coordination and trying out different things may surprise not just your team but you as well you're going to jump head up break through the window and place two turrets all right okay here hold on hold on wa wait so I'm going to place this jump Pad Place the turrets then we're going to go around over that side and you're going to jump P okay yeah yeah all right okay let's go turret jump drop all right now come back there I a jump pad right here moving follow go flank oh my God please oh my God oh my God what the [ __ ] dude so there you have it that's how you use medium get creative use your movement and support skills to your advantage keep your team alive and have some fun if you enjoyed the video consider leaving a like And subscribe for more finals content also leave a comment below if you found some tips and tricks you want to share while using the medium class that's all I got for today thanks for watching and I'll see you next time,"The player seems to be a seasoned participant in 'The Finals' with around 650 hours of gameplay. They appreciate the flexibility of the medium class which can function as both a support and an assault class. The opinion is that it can deal as much damage as a heavy or light class while offering better team support. 

The heal beam, a feature of the medium class, is seen as a powerful tool despite its nerf in the season 4 update. The player suggests using it defensively to support the team rather than aggressively, highlighting the 'body block heal strat' as an effective technique. However, this player recognizes that not everyone may prefer the heal beam, and encourages others to find specializations and gadgets that suit their style. 

For self-preservation, this player relies on tools like the goo grenade and dematerializer. They emphasize the importance of staying alive and dealing damage, even if one cannot finish off an opponent, as it allows teammates to help.

However, there are no specific opinions mentioned about the cl40 weapon or its performance post the 4.2.0 update in this text. Further data would be needed to provide insights on this. The player seems to appreciate the balance and variety of gameplay options offered by the medium class in 'The Finals', particularly after the 4.2.0 update. The player highlights that the medium class is a support class and encourages using weapons, gadgets, and the environment to outplay opponents. The player gives high praise to the F car, acknowledging that understanding its recoil pattern has made it more satisfying to use, especially with the update that allows the scope to be removed. 

However, the player also points out the importance of not relying solely on weapons, but utilizing the class's ability to defibrillate downed teammates and deploy mines. The player seems to be particularly fond of the glitch mine, stating that despite its nerf in the 4.2.0 update, it remains powerful and frustrating for opponents. The player seems to believe the cl40 weapon performs well in the medium class after the 4.2.0 update. 

The player suggests that the medium class may be best suited for players who prefer a support role, defending cash outs, and employing a more tactical style of play. Overall, the player seems to enjoy the game post-update and finds the new mechanics and balancing changes to be satisfactory. The text does not provide explicit opinions on the weapon balancing or the performance of the CL40 after the 4.2.0 update for the game 'The Finals'. However, it does emphasize that strategy and team coordination are crucial in the game. There is a suggestion of using the medium class creatively, and to utilize movement and support skills to keep your team alive. This might imply that the medium class, and possibly the CL40, are diverse and adaptable in their use. The text also mentions placing two turrets, which might be a strategy specifically tied to the CL40 or the medium class. The reaction to the strategy (""oh my God what the [ __ ] dude"") suggests surprise and possible success. But without further context or explicit mention of the CL40 or the 4.2.0 update, it's hard to draw any specific conclusions about the weapon or update."

cl40 weapon after the 4.2.0 update in 'The Finals' seems to be mixed. The user expresses appreciation for the remarkable support the medium main offers, and he seems to play it aggressively, treating it more like a light weapon. He also appreciates the team-oriented nature of the game.

However, there are a few issues raised. The grenade launcher, which can be paired with the cl40, is described as 'kind of mid' despite popular opinion, and it seems primarily useful for repelling light attacks. After that, it's considered less effective. 

The user also indicates that the game requires a lot of focus and quick decision-making, implying that the cl40 might be challenging to manage in high-pressure scenarios. However, despite the challenges, the user seems to enjoy the gameplay and the strategic aspects of managing the cl40 in 'The Finals'. 

Overall, the cl40 after the 4.2.0 update seems to offer a unique and challenging experience that requires strategy and quick reflexes, which some players might appreciate while others might find demanding. This passage is a bit chaotic and doesn't provide concrete opinions about weapon balancing or the cl40's performance after the 4.2.0 update. However, we can infer some possible points:

1. The player seems to be having difficulty navigating certain areas and dealing with debris, which could potentially point to game design issues rather than weapon balancing. 
   
2. They mention ""grenade launchers hurt,"" which could imply that grenade launchers are powerful or perhaps overpowered in the game after the update.

3. They also talk about a different team gaining control, which could suggest team balancing issues or gameplay strategy challenges.

4. They say ""I'm going to stick with it,"" referring to a weapon (possibly cl40). This could imply that they believe in the weapon's potential or are willing to work with its current balance.

However, without more context or explicit statements, it's hard to provide a detailed analysis. For a thorough review of weapon balancing and performance, we need more direct feedback on the weapons, their impact in gameplay, and comparisons between pre- and post-update functionality. The opinion about the cl40 weapon after the 4.2.0 update for the game 'The Finals' seems to be negative. The player describes the weapon as ""garbage"" and ""ass light"" which indicates that they believe it performs poorly. They suggest that it is only effective against ""lights"" and not much else, suggesting that it lacks versatility in combat. They also mention having to play ""a little bit indoors"" to avoid getting picked, which could indicate the weapon doesn't perform well in long-range engagements. However, they did mention using the ""good old mine and cl40 combo to insta kill"", suggesting that the weapon can be effective when used in combination with certain strategies or other equipment. The overall experience of the player seems to be frustrating, and they express disbelief at certain situations, indicating a dissatisfaction with the weapon's performance. Despite this, they manage to score some kills and even win the game, although it's unclear how much the cl40 contributed to this success."

The Finals Medium Meta,81CpaQSUMG8,How to Win More with Medium Class – The Finals Pro Tips,medium is the most used Class in the finals right now I think and after close to 650 hours in the game I want to share the things I've learned Ming medium and high level lobbies but before you jump in the arena make sure you know what you're up against one of the things I like to do is check the leaderboard before getting into the game this way I know which classes I'm up against and I can choose my counter weapons and gadgets if I see a lot of lights in my Lobby for example I'll choose between the F card the revolver or the model 1887 because I counter best lights with those weapons one of the most interesting things I found about this game is how Embark managed to make the medium a support class while also acting as an assault class you can do just as much damage if not more than a heavy or light while still supporting your team more than they can this brings me to the heal beam I've seen a lot less medium players use the heal beam after their season 4 Nerf but it's still an extremely powerful tool for the medium class I'm sure we've all been against a three medium heal beam circle jerk before I'm back circle jerk circle jerk circle jerk circle jerk circle jerk but remember you don't always have to be aggressive as medium you can hang back with the heal beam and watch the show I'm healing you bro I'm healing you bro I'm healing you bro it's all you bro nice another thing you can do with the heal beam is the body block heal Strat that I'm sure you've all encountered before which is also really good for the last second steals but hey if you're not a heal beam guy that's okay with me you have to find the best specializations and gadgets that fit your play style I personally like to stay alive as long as I can so I've been using a lot of things to keep me alive like the goo grenade and dematerializer as of recent Staying Alive while dealing damage to your opponents helps your team a lot because even if you can't finish someone off on your own your team is there to help you and if one of your teammates go down you can defib someone and keep them alive speaking of staying alive make sure you're using your movement and gadgets to outplay your opponents this is especially useful when fighting in buildings cuz the enemies never expect a window jump when I'm being chased utilize your gadgets use Goo or grenades or flashbangs whatever you need to help stay alive this kind of goes for every class but let's say you aren't running the right gadgets or you ran out well using the canisters around the map is extremely underrated I've gotten out of so many situations where I should have died but a trusty goo canister or red canister was there to save my life when I should have very easily died for all you AR users make sure you learn The Recoil pattern of your gun with that said I don't even fully know the recoil pattern of every gun I have the memory of a goldfish but I do remember the F car pattern because all the bullets do is go up to the right slightly this one was very easy to learn for me and with the season 4 update allowing me to remove the scope the F car has become a lot more satisfying to use so before jumping into a game check out the patterns in the practice range or do what I do and just shoot a wall when you join a game for a quick reminder of The Recoil pattern remember that Medium is a support class so if you're the type of player that likes defending cash outs then don't be sleeping on the mines sometimes you can get away with some pretty ridiculous things a man uh on that the will have to oh my God oh my oh my no [ __ ] way dude that's wild that is insane the glitch mine is still very powerful despite its season 4 Nerf you only get one but you can place two on the map once it's done charging up throwing a glitch mine on a statue is a great counter to other mediums and it's one of the most frustrating things they can encounter going for a defib on your teammate and being glitched and switched to your primary weapon is not a good time team coordination is huge in this game and I I get it solo cubing is tough but try to find someone you played well with and AD them having your team all push someone is easily one of the best ways to win and having coordination and trying out different things may surprise not just your team but you as well you're going to jump head up break through the window and place two turrets all right okay here hold on hold on wa wait so I'm going to place this jump Pad Place the turrets then we're going to go around over that side and you're going to jump P okay yeah yeah all right okay let's go turret jump drop all right now come back there I a jump pad right here moving follow go flank oh my God please oh my God oh my God what the [ __ ] dude so there you have it that's how you use medium get creative use your movement and support skills to your advantage keep

The Finals Medium Meta,PaSJNoNkh60,How to be the Medium Player that your teammates will love,so you want to play the medium class maybe it's because you saw how some of the top players play medium and decided that you want to take your gameplay to that level or maybe you've gotten addicted to the movement that the zip line and the jump pad provide you or maybe you just saw the AK-47 and decided yep yep this is this is the class it's been decided whatever the case may be you've come to the right place with this video I'll be giving you all the information that you need so that you can stop your gaml from looking like this here let me get this defib off real quick jump pad there's a guy turret out you're done for it buddy there's two what the what that there's two of them that's not that's not fair as a medium you are playing one of the most versatile classes in the game you're good on attack defense and support but with these advantages comes a large skill Gap that you need to be aware of when you pick this character so to help you climb that skill Gap I'm going to be providing a bunch of tips for every medium specialization throughout this video as well as tips for medium class as a whole and with all that being said let's get started so the very first thing that I'm going to do here is put down this jump pad for my team right here which allows me and in particular my heavy teammate to get very aggressive with the Enemy team I noticed that my Heavy's health bar is getting kind of low and at this time I take a ton of damage so I reposition and heal my heavy so he can take the fight instead I'm also going to do a quick defp on the heavy teammate which is just going to give us a lot more certainty in being able to close out this fight but something that I've noticed is that there there are a lot of people who use defibs at really bad times so I'm going to quickly explain when you should defib and when you should not this is when it's okay to defib if you can gain numbers advantage on the enemy team or at least equal out your team numbers to stall a cash out and divert attention in emergencies and to quickly reset if you expect a third party but there are many times when you should not defib some of these are if someone is already resing if you are unlikely to win the fight even with the defib an instance of this would be if you are in a 1v3 and everybody is at half or more Health if you have to die for the res in some cases this one is okay but 95% of the time dying to get a defib off is a really bad idea and if you are in no danger and you can save it for later treat your defib like a valuable commodity do not waste it so now that I've discussed when you should and shouldn't defib let's go back to the gameplay examples after we've secured this cashbox it's time to put our movement to use again taking height is very important in this game because if you don't have someone else will and medium's utility lets you get that height Advantage very fast I heard some enemy footsteps so I decided to Ping wildly to let my team no to group up if you are playing solo queue and something important like this is happening please use your ping Button as it can really be the difference between you winning that fight and you losing that [Applause] fight one contestant doesn't seem now some of you may have noticed that we are leaving this cash out before it's completed we are doing this because this cash out is honestly almost done and it's highly unlikely that a team steals during this time and before this I had checked the scoreboard and I had seen that all of the teams were actually doing damage which means that they are all fighting over the cash out more than likely however this is where I almost make a crucial mistake not playing with my team it's important to play buyer team when you are a medium or a heavy but especially as a heal beam when I realize my mistake I immediately go to regroup with my heavy who can hopefully protect me my heavy decided to dome shield in and go for the cash out but instead of healing him the whole time like a lot of mediums would I Instead try to kill the people shooting at him there's a time into place for healing but if you can outright kill an opponent it's better to do that instead of just healing King them and hoping that they survive after I deposited this cash out I noticed that D already has a fair bit of progress on it and it's close by that means there's the potential for us to be able to take both cash outs and if we could pull that off that would be a huge Advantage but before I push in I try to get some opening damage from long range and wait for my heavy to push in ahead of me when you're the healbe medum you want to try to be the Last One Alive as often as possible as he takes the cash out I'm going to watch to make sure that nobody tries to kill him while he takes it once again this medium shows up near the end of the Steal but because the cash out is nearly stolen I go to heal instead of kill after I whiff some really easy shots here I go to defib the heavy in case of a third party now here is a very important decision making moment when I go over to push up on this cash box I notice that the timer is nearly up and both of my teammates are busy fighting so if we want to take this box I have to act now luckily my teammates were able to body block for me and we were able to take it so while you as a heal beam medium probably shouldn't be the one taking the cash box in certain Niche scenarios like this you just might have to do it anyways also if this video has been helpful consider leaving it a like as it really does help me out a ton and if you like the sound of mostly weekly finals videos consider subscribing it's okay I can wait okay I'm done now let's get back to the video in this game I'm in a triple medium team and I'm playing with dematerializer with dmat you can afford to play a little bit more aggressively and a little bit more like a light player because you don't have to worry about healing your teammates so I'm going to be pretty front and center in a lot of these fights I see that the heavy has put up a barricade and is playing behind it so I decide to pressure him with the dmat my teammate manages to take down the heavy but then goes down but instead of getting the defibr I leave that to the other more support focused medium in my team and try to go and finish off the light once again I'm going to give my team a little bit of movement so we can deposit the cash box faster and then we're going to to take height it's actually a much better idea to not hold the cash boox on the moving platform but instead to follow it around from High Ground if you get this specific event instead of chasing this team across and trying to kill them we are going to take this zip line all the way to the top of Apartments where we will be able to hold a much better position and can use our movement gadgets to quickly rotate to the platform if necessary if this team doesn't want to get jump padded on top of they're going to have to challenge us while we have the positioning Advantage at this point I go into get aggressive with my dmat and get their attention and some opening damage but then I rotate out with my jump pad and let my teammates clean up after we finish this fight we're going to use the zipline to once again rotate over to the next building and be ready for another fight if necessary and sure enough pink team is going for the Cash Out station so I decide to drop down and keep them from stealing the cash out even if it means that I end up dying I managed to stop them from stealing with my aggressive play and while they are focused on dealing with me my teammates are able to get some pretty free damage on so this next engagement is a really good example of how you should play dmat around cash out a lot of dmat players would like to drop the cash out immediately upon depositing the cash box but this isn't a great idea here I'm going to hold the high ground with the rest of my team to try and stop the enemy before they even reach the cash out here by playing below the cash out instead of above it I can drop it down and stall for longer and possibly isolate A3 V1 if I also manage to get one of the opponents then me and my team are going to rotate to the floor below again to do the exact same thing here pink team finds us and takes a fight but because we aren't playing in the room with the cash boox we are limiting our chances of being attacked by a third party after I whiff some of my shots I go and defit my teammate instead of slow resing because I hear footsteps and I expect that I will need to drop the cash out immediately some other ways that you can use the dmat is by playing very aggressively with it and cutting off opponents who might be running away from you [Music] at the time of recording this video turret is easily the worst specialization you can use for medium unless you play terminal attack however if you still want to use it I do have a few tips for you on how you can maximize your turret efficiency be careful about some of the materials that you place your turrets on for instance these ceilings on Soul tend to break really e easily and if your turret falls down from them it's pretty much useless a lot of players expect you to place your turrets near the cash out but if you do this too much it can become predictable and your turrets lose a lot of their value FX it up once in a while by placing it in an area away from the cash out where you can either fall back to or play from to catch the Enemy by surprise another example of good turret placement is this clip right here where I placed it in a space that will cover either staircase from the enemy that they could push up from Once the turret does some opening damage I Engage The Enemy while they are distracted to get a quick kill I also tend to notice a lot of turret medium players like to sit by their turret at all times you don't need to do this and this actually limits you a lot don't be afraid to push enemies and then when they chase you go run back to where your turret is placed to make them really choose between whether they want to keep pushing you or if they want to back up and not deal with that turret something else that I do to mix things up as well is placing my turret in one area for the first fight at a cash out and then moving it after that fight is finished to be much closer to the cash out this usually really catches my opponents off guard and can be a great way to mix up your strategy but besides these tips just play turret medium in a similar way to the dematerialize your medium and you should be fine and those are a bunch of ways that you can be a better medium player now all of these things can be quite a lot to take in so if you feel overwhelmed by all this information just try focusing on one thing at a time until you've mastered that and then move on to the next thing I really hope that this video was helpful and entertaining and if it was consider giving it a like as it really does help out the channel and consider subscribing for mostly weekly videos on the finals and with that I'll see you in the next one [Music],"Based on the provided information, it appears that the user appreciates the

The user's opinion on the medium class appears to be favorable overall, but they stress the need for skill and strategic play to fully leverage this class's capabilities.

This text doesn't provide any detailed opinions about weapon balancing or comments on the cl40 after the 4.2.0 update for the game 'The Finals'.

It also mentions the importance of not wasting defibs and playing strategically. However, no specific weapon or update is discussed in detail.

The CL40 appears to be used for long-range opening damage before pushing in alongside a heavy class player, indicating that it may maintain good performance at a distance. However, there's a hint that the player missed some easy shots, which may suggest issues with accuracy, but this could also be player error.

nice,"This passage doesn't provide a detailed opinion about the weapon balancing and overall performance of the cl40 after the 4.2.0 update for the game 'The Finals'. It seems to be a general commentary on a multiplayer gaming session, where the speaker discusses various weapons and strategies, but doesn't specifically mention the cl40 or the 4.2.0 update. The extracted opinions on weapon balancing and performance of the cl40 after the 4.2.0 update for the game 'The Finals' are quite diverse and not clearly stated. However, we can infer from the text that:

1. One player is frustrated with the damage dealt by a weapon, rendering it overpowered in their opinion. It is unclear if this is about the cl40, though.
2. The player mentions the annoyance of being killed instantly with a headshot, implying that some weapons might have an imbalance in terms of damage.
3. There seems to be an issue with targeting or accuracy, as the player mentions not being able to hit or spot opponents, suggesting that the cl40 might need improvements in this area.
4. The player mentions someone being 'super low', possibly referring to the health of an opponent after being hit, which may suggest that the cl40 doesn't deal enough damage.
5. There is a mention of 'stealing cover', which might be a strategy or game mechanic, but it's unclear how this relates to the cl40 or weapon balance.
6. The player expresses frustration with a teammate not supporting them, not directly related to the cl40 but could indicate team dynamics affecting gameplay.
7. The player refers to tagging an opponent through the floor, potentially indicating an issue with the game's physics or a feature of the cl40.
8. The player mentions '75x', which could refer to a weapon or upgrade in the game, unclear The text provided seems to be a direct transcription of in-game communication and it's a bit chaotic and hard to analyze for specific opinions on weapon balancing and the cl40's performance post 4.2.0 update. 

However, a few inferences can be made:

1. The player mentions needing to reload frequently and running out of bullets quickly, which could indicate a dissatisfaction with the ammunition capacity or rate of fire of their weapon, potentially the cl40.

2. There are mentions of the player doing a lot of damage but others getting the kills. This might suggest that they feel their weapon, potentially the cl40, deals high damage but isn't as effective at securing kills, potentially due to a slow firing rate or poor accuracy. 

3. The player also expresses frustration about other players being able to ""one tap"" enemies, implying that they might feel their weapon is imbalanced compared to others. 

4. The player's repeated frustration about having their kills stolen might indicate their dissatisfaction with the weapon's kill-confirming ability.

5. The player also mentions ""the 75x is weak"". If the 75x is another weapon in the medium class, it can be inferred that there is a perception of imbalance within the class, with the cl40 potentially seen as superior.

6. The mention of the ""75x cashing out"" may suggest that despite being perceived as weak, the weapon still performs well in certain situations, indicating a potential balance in the weapon's performance From the text provided, it's challenging to extract detailed opinions about the weapon balancing and overall performance of the cl40 after the 4.2.0 update for the game 'The Finals'. The text seems to be a real-time commentary of gameplay rather than a discussion or review of the mentioned weapon. There's no explicit mention of the cl40 or its performance after the update. 

For a detailed analysis or opinion on the cl40 or any weapon, we would need specific comments on its attributes like damage, range, recoil, etc., and how these have changed or remained the same after the update. Also, any comparison with other weapons and their balance in the game would help in drawing a comprehensive opinion. 

This analysis can be redone once relevant data or commentary is provided. Unfortunately, the text provided doesn't contain any specific information related to weapon balancing, overall opinions, or the performance of the cl40 after the 4.2.0 update for the game 'The Finals'. It seems to be a conversation or commentary during a game play, with mentions of actions like shooting, taking heights, helping teammates, and dealing with enemies but no explicit mention or analysis of the game's weapons or updates. This passage seems to be a stream of consciousness during a game match, with players communicating about their strategies and actions. However, there are some points which could be extrapolated to infer opinions about weapon balancing and the performance of the cl40 after the 4.2.0 update:

1. The player mentions having trouble killing an opponent: ""like that guy should be dead I don't know what I'm doing"". This might indicate that the player feels the damage output of their weapon (possibly the cl40) is inadequate.

2. The player seems to express dissatisfaction with a respawn timer: ""such a long respawn timer oh [__] wow that's my fault"". This might not be directly related to weapon balancing but does indicate a potential issue with game mechanics after the 4.2.0 update.

3. The player also mentions the damage they've done: ""you guys have more than less than a thousand damage though I barely seen anybody"". This could suggest that the player feels the cl40 is not dealing enough damage, or they're not encountering enough opponents to utilize it effectively.

4. The player expresses frustration with their aim: ""I just whiffed on the [__] GL [__]"". This could be a critique on either the game's aiming mechanics post-update or their own skill.

In conclusion, this passage seems to suggest that the player might be struggling with the cl40's damage output and potentially the aiming mechanics after the 4.2.0 update Given the provided excerpt, it's challenging to extract specific opinions on the CL40 weapon and its performance after the 4.2.0 update for 'The Finals'. The comments seem to be more general game commentary rather than specific impressions or opinions on the CL40. There is also no explicit mention of the 4.2.0 update and how it might have impacted the weapon's performance.

For a comprehensive analysis, more specific feedback or comments regarding weapon balancing, the CL40's performance, and the effects of the 4.2.0 update would be needed. This could include players' opinions on the weapon's damage, accuracy, or handling post-update, or any perceived imbalance compared to other medium class weapons. The text provided does not contain specific opinions or feedback about the weapon balancing or performance of the cl40 after the 4.2.0 update for the game 'The Finals'. To provide an analysis, please provide relevant data or player comments that specifically discuss these topics."

The Finals Medium Meta,81CpaQSUMG8,How to Win More with Medium Class – The Finals Pro Tips,medium is the most used Class in the finals right now I think and after close to 650 hours in the game I want to share the things I've learned Ming medium and high level lobbies but before you jump in the arena make sure you know what you're up against one of the things I like to do is check the leaderboard before getting into the game this way I know which classes I'm up against and I can choose my counter weapons and gadgets if I see a lot of lights in my Lobby for example I'll choose between the F card the revolver or the model 1887 because I counter best lights with those weapons one of the most interesting things I found about this game is how Embark managed to make the medium a support class while also acting as an assault class you can do just as much damage if not more than a heavy or light while still supporting your team more than they can this brings me to the heal beam I've seen a lot less medium players use the heal beam after their season 4 Nerf but it's still an extremely powerful tool for the medium class I'm sure we've all been against a three medium heal beam circle jerk before I'm back circle jerk circle jerk circle jerk circle jerk circle jerk but remember you don't always have to be aggressive as medium you can hang back with the heal beam and watch the show I'm healing you bro I'm healing you bro I'm healing you bro it's all you bro nice another thing you can do with the heal beam is the body block heal Strat that I'm sure you've all encountered before which is also really good for the last second steals but hey if you're not a heal beam guy that's okay with me you have to find the best specializations and gadgets that fit your play style I personally like to stay alive as long as I can so I've been using a lot of things to keep me alive like the goo grenade and dematerializer as of recent Staying Alive while dealing damage to your opponents helps your team a lot because even if you can't finish someone off on your own your team is there to help you and if one of your teammates go down you can defib someone and keep them alive speaking of staying alive make sure you're using your movement and gadgets to outplay your opponents this is especially useful when fighting in buildings cuz the enemies never expect a window jump when I'm being chased utilize your gadgets use Goo or grenades or flashbangs whatever you need to help stay alive this kind of goes for every class but let's say you aren't running the right gadgets or you ran out well using the canisters around the map is extremely underrated I've gotten out of so many situations where I should have died but a trusty goo canister or red canister was there to save my life when I should have very easily died for all you AR users make sure you learn The Recoil pattern of your gun with that said I don't even fully know the recoil pattern of every gun I have the memory of a goldfish but I do remember the F car pattern because all the bullets do is go up to the right slightly this one was very easy to learn for me and with the season 4 update allowing me to remove the scope the F car has become a lot more satisfying to use so before jumping into a game check out the patterns in the practice range or do what I do and just shoot a wall when you join a game for a quick reminder of The Recoil pattern remember that Medium is a support class so if you're the type of player that likes defending cash outs then don't be sleeping on the mines sometimes you can get away with some pretty ridiculous things a man uh on that the will have to oh my God oh my oh my no [ __ ] way dude that's wild that is insane the glitch mine is still very powerful despite its season 4 Nerf you only get one but you can place two on the map once it's done charging up throwing a glitch mine on a statue is a great counter to other mediums and it's one of the most frustrating things they can encounter going for a defib on your teammate and being glitched and switched to your primary weapon is not a good time team coordination is huge in this game and I I get it solo cubing is tough but try to find someone you played well with and AD them having your team all push someone is easily one of the best ways to win and having coordination and trying out different things may surprise not just your team but you as well you're going to jump head up break through the window and place two turrets all right okay here hold on hold on wa wait so I'm going to place this jump Pad Place the turrets then we're going to go around over that side and you're going to jump P okay yeah yeah all right okay let's go turret jump drop all right now come back there I a jump pad right here moving follow go flank oh my God please oh my God oh my God what the [ __ ] dude so there you have it that's how you use medium get creative use your movement and support skills to your advantage keep your team alive and have some fun if you enjoyed the video consider leaving a like And subscribe for more finals content also leave a comment below if you found some tips and tricks you want to share while using the medium class that's all I got for today thanks for watching and I'll see you next time,"The player has spent considerable time (650 hours) in the game, which gives their opinion a strong foundation. They see the medium class as a versatile one, capable of damage output similar to heavy or light while also acting as a support class. This flexibility is one of the reasons the medium class is heavily used in 'The Finals'. 

One key tool for the medium class, the heal beam, is mentioned as extremely powerful. Even though usage has decreased after the season 4 nerf, the player believes it is still effective. The heal beam allows the medium class to support their team by reviving health and can also be used strategically for body blocking.

As for the Pike 556, the player didn't specifically mention it in their discussion. However, they do emphasize the importance of choosing weapons and gadgets that best fit individual playstyles. The player personally prefers to use tools that help them stay alive longer, such as the goo grenade and dematerializer.

In conclusion, while there isn't a specific opinion on the Pike 556 after the 4.2.0 update, the overall sentiment towards the medium class is positive, particularly due to its versatility and the strategic options it provides players. The heal beam, despite its nerf, is still seen as an effective tool for this class.

The Finals Medium Meta,PaSJNoNkh60,How to be the Medium Player that your teammates will love,so you want to play the medium class maybe it's because you saw how some of the top players play medium and decided that you want to take your gameplay to that level or maybe you've gotten addicted to the movement that the zip line and the jump pad provide you or maybe you just saw the AK-47 and decided yep yep this is this is the class it's been decided whatever the case may be you've come to the right place with this video I'll be giving you all the information that you need so that you can stop your gaml from looking like this here let me get this defib off real quick jump pad there's a guy turret out you're done for it buddy there's two what the what that there's two of them that's not that's not fair as a medium you are playing one of the most versatile classes in the game you're good on attack defense and support but with these advantages comes a large skill Gap that you need to be aware of when you pick this character so to help you climb that skill Gap I'm going to be providing a bunch of tips for every medium specialization throughout this video as well as tips for medium class as a whole and with all that being said let's get started so the very first thing that I'm going to do here is put down this jump pad for my team right here which allows me and in particular my heavy teammate to get very aggressive with the Enemy team I noticed that my Heavy's health bar is getting kind of low and at this time I take a ton of damage so I reposition and heal my heavy so he can take the fight instead I'm also going to do a quick defp on the heavy teammate which is just going to give us a lot more certainty in being able to close out this fight but something that I've noticed is that there there are a lot of people who use defibs at really bad times so I'm going to quickly explain when you should defib and when you should not this is when it's okay to defib if you can gain numbers advantage on the enemy team or at least equal out your team numbers to stall a cash out and divert attention in emergencies and to quickly reset if you expect a third party but there are many times when you should not defib some of these are if someone is already resing if you are unlikely to win the fight even with the defib an instance of this would be if you are in a 1v3 and everybody is at half or more Health if you have to die for the res in some cases this one is okay but 95% of the time dying to get a defib off is a really bad idea and if you are in no danger and you can save it for later treat your defib like a valuable commodity do not waste it so now that I've discussed when you should and shouldn't defib let's go back to the gameplay examples after we've secured this cashbox it's time to put our movement to use again taking height is very important in this game because if you don't have someone else will and medium's utility lets you get that height Advantage very fast I heard some enemy footsteps so I decided to Ping wildly to let my team no to group up if you are playing solo queue and something important like this is happening please use your ping Button as it can really be the difference between you winning that fight and you losing that [Applause] fight one contestant doesn't seem now some of you may have noticed that we are leaving this cash out before it's completed we are doing this because this cash out is honestly almost done and it's highly unlikely that a team steals during this time and before this I had checked the scoreboard and I had seen that all of the teams were actually doing damage which means that they are all fighting over the cash out more than likely however this is where I almost make a crucial mistake not playing with my team it's important to play buyer team when you are a medium or a heavy but especially as a heal beam when I realize my mistake I immediately go to regroup with my heavy who can hopefully protect me my heavy decided to dome shield in and go for the cash out but instead of healing him the whole time like a lot of mediums would I Instead try to kill the people shooting at him there's a time into place for healing but if you can outright kill an opponent it's better to do that instead of just healing King them and hoping that they survive after I deposited this cash out I noticed that D already has a fair bit of progress on it and it's close by that means there's the potential for us to be able to take both cash outs and if we could pull that off that would be a huge Advantage but before I push in I try to get some opening damage from long range and wait for my heavy to push in ahead of me when you're the healbe medum you want to try to be the Last One Alive as often as possible as he takes the cash out I'm going to watch to make sure that nobody tries to kill him while he takes it once again this medium shows up near the end of the Steal but because the cash out is nearly stolen I go to heal instead of kill after I whiff some really easy shots here I go to defib the heavy in case of a third party now here is a very important decision making moment when I go over to push up on this cash box I notice that the timer is nearly up and both of my teammates are busy fighting so if we want to take this box I have to act now luckily my teammates were able to body block for me and we were able to take it so while you as a heal beam medium probably shouldn't be the one taking the cash box in certain Niche scenarios like this you just might have to do it anyways also if this video has been helpful consider leaving it a like as it really does help me out a ton and if you like the sound of mostly weekly finals videos consider subscribing it's okay I can wait okay I'm done now let's get back to the video in this game I'm in a triple medium team and I'm playing with dematerializer with dmat you can afford to play a little bit more aggressively and a little bit more like a light player because you don't have to worry about healing your teammates so I'm going to be pretty front and center in a lot of these fights I see that the heavy has put up a barricade and is playing behind it so I decide to pressure him with the dmat my teammate manages to take down the heavy but then goes down but instead of getting the defibr I leave that to the other more support focused medium in my team and try to go and finish off the light once again I'm going to give my team a little bit of movement so we can deposit the cash box faster and then we're going to to take height it's actually a much better idea to not hold the cash boox on the moving platform but instead to follow it around from High Ground if you get this specific event instead of chasing this team across and trying to kill them we are going to take this zip line all the way to the top of Apartments where we will be able to hold a much better position and can use our movement gadgets to quickly rotate to the platform if necessary if this team doesn't want to get jump padded on top of they're going to have to challenge us while we have the positioning Advantage at this point I go into get aggressive with my dmat and get their attention and some opening damage but then I rotate out with my jump pad and let my teammates clean up after we finish this fight we're going to use the zipline to once again rotate over to the next building and be ready for another fight if necessary and sure enough pink team is going for the Cash Out station so I decide to drop down and keep them from stealing the cash out even if it means that I end up dying I managed to stop them from stealing with my aggressive play and while they are focused on dealing with me my teammates are able to get some pretty free damage on so this next engagement is a really good example of how you should play dmat around cash out a lot of dmat players would like to drop the cash out immediately upon depositing the cash box but this isn't a great idea here I'm going to hold the high ground with the rest of my team to try and stop the enemy before they even reach the cash out here by playing below the cash out instead of above it I can drop it down and stall for longer and possibly isolate A3 V1 if I also manage to get one of the opponents then me and my team are going to rotate to the floor below again to do the exact same thing here pink team finds us and takes a fight but because we aren't playing in the room with the cash boox we are limiting our chances of being attacked by a third party after I whiff some of my shots I go and defit my teammate instead of slow resing because I hear footsteps and I expect that I will need to drop the cash out immediately some other ways that you can use the dmat is by playing very aggressively with it and cutting off opponents who might be running away from you [Music] at the time of recording this video turret is easily the worst specialization you can use for medium unless you play terminal attack however if you still want to use it I do have a few tips for you on how you can maximize your turret efficiency be careful about some of the materials that you place your turrets on for instance these ceilings on Soul tend to break really e easily and if your turret falls down from them it's pretty much useless a lot of players expect you to place your turrets near the cash out but if you do this too much it can become predictable and your turrets lose a lot of their value FX it up once in a while by placing it in an area away from the cash out where you can either fall back to or play from to catch the Enemy by surprise another example of good turret placement is this clip right here where I placed it in a space that will cover either staircase from the enemy that they could push up from Once the turret does some opening damage I Engage The Enemy while they are distracted to get a quick kill I also tend to notice a lot of turret medium players like to sit by their turret at all times you don't need to do this and this actually limits you a lot don't be afraid to push enemies and then when they chase you go run back to where your turret is placed to make them really choose between whether they want to keep pushing you or if they want to back up and not deal with that turret something else that I do to mix things up as well is placing my turret in one area for the first fight at a cash out and then moving it after that fight is finished to be much closer to the cash out this usually really catches my opponents off guard and can be a great way to mix up your strategy but besides these tips just play turret medium in a similar way to the dematerialize your medium and you should be fine and those are a bunch of ways that you can be a better medium player now all of these things can be quite a lot to take in so if you feel overwhelmed by all this information just try focusing on one thing at a time until you've mastered that and then move on to the next thing I really hope that this video was helpful and entertaining and if it was consider giving it a like as it really does help out the channel

The Finals Season 4,RAVyAwBl32Q,Is The Finals Being Gatekept? (Season 4),in today's video I kind of want to go a little off the cuff I'm not going to add any infographics no fancy editing just me talking to you about some thoughts bouncing up here in my Noggin I've seen more than enough posts on Reddit as well as comments on my YouTube videos saying the same things as to why this game is not doing as well as it should reasons such as having subpar quality the balancing sucks too many cheaters and monetization is horrible when the reality of it is some of these statements are far from the truth and the rest are problems that every FP s has to an even higher degree the quality of this game in my opinion is in a league of its own with a team that is significantly smaller than that of a major AAA Studio the balancing is always being modified because they are actually listening to the players regardless if the suggestions are good or bad now they might not give you exactly what you want as an individual but the fact is they're listening to what the majority of the player base want and saying that they don't listen at all is a grossly false statement at the least as for cheaters please tell me what game is completely free of them while you're at it please tell me what game you can manly report them to Discord where a person can actually take a look at the evidence I'll wait because I don't know if it's just me but whenever I've reported a cheater in game three out of five times I would get a confirmation within the next week that they've been banned now if you are an ordinary player that reports someone in Apex Legends good luck because you're more than likely going to see that player in the top 700 at the end of the season facing no repercussions whatsoever and hell in war zone you could even make a career out of cheating in fact the finals has taken the first steps to combat software such as rewas to which other games had to take notice and start following suit I can go on and on about this topic but trust me the grass is not greener on the other side believe that and as for monetization the prices are not only fair but they even allow you to buy particular items from a bundle that you want rather than the entire bundle itself and for this current Halloween event you have the opportunity to get 27 free rewards and these rewards are not just stickers or charms some are actually quality skins whether or not the player is actually able to obtain them all is a different story but still the fact of the matter is there is a ways and means of potentially receiving them for free in contrast to apex's collection event which gives you a charm sticker or depending on how much they've pissed off the player base maybe even a skin now that we have a little perspective it is in my opinion that these are not the reasons why the finals is not doing as well as it should it is simply because players don't want to throw away the skill acquired from the game they are currently playing just to start all over again from scratch with something new even if that new game is Superior in every single aspect the majority of players just don't want to throw away that time invested this is particularly because of the increasingly competitive culture we live in today where everyone wants to be a well-known streamer or the best esport athlete known to man to sweat their balls off with the best of them and playing the game is for potential monetization rather than just for the fun of it this is blatantly clear with the abundance of TTV or kick names that you see in every other match no offense to anyone that does stream but this is just the reality of things because in order for this game to really find huge success is for one of the big four to fail which is Apex fortnite Call of Duty or OverWatch I know there are a lot of other huge titles but these are the most similar in terms of gameplay to the finals my point being is that Embark needs to play a game of patrici by making sure that the finals is in a great state so that when not if one of these big four fail the finals will be ready to receive a huge chunk of the players in the power vacuum the game Left Behind allowing it to finally achieve the recognition it deserves now failing can come in many ways not just by low player population it can also come in the way of people just having enough enough of their money time and effort being taken advantage of and when that time comes the finals will be waiting for them with open arms so if you're a player that's sitting on the fence thinking to yourself I don't know if I want to give this game a solid chance because I've invested way too much time in a particular game I want you to remember this because it took me a while to realize it as well that the fundamentals of aim such as Target acquisition click timing and tracking are consistent throughout all these major titles some may heavily rely on one aspect than the others but in general if you have solid fundamentals of aim you can easily transfer skill from one game to another this is why players like shroud or ASU can hop on to almost any FPS and quickly be proficient at it because they're able to use their fundamentals to find similarities of skill to transfer from one game to another anyhow I'm starting to feel like I'm going on a tangent here and I don't want to keep rambling on but yeah what are your thoughts is it because of bigger games gatekeeping the finals or is it because of other factors that is preventing this game from reaching its true potential I love to hear from you but again keep it civil if you enjoyed this video please drop a like And subscribe for all things to fin us the rest of the video is just going to be game play so peace and love guys and I'll see you in the [Music]

The Finals Season 4,ef_7iYeNR_k,I tried and ranked EVERY gadget in The Finals SEASON 4,season 4 made some pretty big changes to some of the gadgets for every class and for today's video I used every single one of them and ranked them from D tier to S tier in my opinion of course there's time stamps for those of you who just want to look for a specific Gadget or see the whole list and with that let's begin the frag grenade has become a staple of my and many other players loadouts recently and for good reason the damage that these things can do is really good and you get two of them and because there's no grenade indicator in the finals these things can really catch a lot of players off guard this is a solid atier pick smoke grenade is a bit of a niche pick but that doesn't mean that it's useless it can put out fires keeps Zer grenades from detecting you and can help you steal cash outs unfortunately that's pretty much where its usage ends it might be more powerful if more people used fire-based gadgets but you don't really see them too often hopefully these things get a buff in the future cuz I'd honestly think it would be a really interesting meta but there's usually better options to pick for your team putting it in the C tier flashbang got some big changes this season that really made it a lot more usable now it will only give you the hit indicators if you fully blind someone and the blind now lasts for longer making these things actually decent well I think some of the other Gadgets in this list provide more value for your team they are not nearly as bad as they used to be landing them in the B tier gas grenade is in a bit of a weird spot right now it's decent for delaying a cash out or doing crowd control damage but it's sometimes a little hard to capitalize off it and some players can also just heal through the damage I'd say it's a niche c-tier pick and maybe if you got two gas grenades or the duration was increased you might see more people using it in the higher level lobbies ponade is also unfortunately another Niche Gadget it can clear out gas and slowly destroy goo which can be helpful and the ability for it to damage through walls and ceilings is also pretty cool but that's where the usefulness ends its damage isn't especially great and the utility it provides is outdone by the thermal board if they increased the damage or gave it an extra charge or two I could maybe see this being used a little bit more but for now it has to go into the C tier go grenade has honestly become a bit of a meta option and I'm really excited about that while it's countered by charging slam and dematerializer its stall potential is honestly really good and I've been seeing a lot of people find great success with it and its ability to create new climbing Pathways trap enemies in rooms or create whole new angles is really valuable Landing it in the a tier explosive mine used to be pretty decent but after the Nerfs to it at the beginning of the season it's really not that great anymore two mines can't even kill a medium and they require way more preparation and luck than something like the frag grenades and while you can drop them on someone taking a cash out with dmat it's a bit of a gimmicky strategy rather than something that is actually viable in most circumstances and in my experience this opportunity rarely comes I put them in the C tier gas mine is a pretty decent method to create area denial and it can be pretty good in some of the lower levels of the game but it's at the higher levels where it starts to fall off as most teams at these levels will opt to just kill the defending team instead of trying to steal midf fight making the gas mines nowhere near as useful I plac them in B tier because they're still decent for most players but their efficacy will really depend on who you're facing even though it was nerfed the RPG is still one of the best gadgets that a heavy can bring it can open or close engagements very easily and it's a great I need this wall broken this second button in gencies it goes into the S tier since RPG got nerfed this is probably the best gadget in Heavy's Arsenal the ability to basically give your team free HP to play around in a matter of seconds is really important and while you have to be more intentional with your use of it now it's still a fantastic Gadget that goes into the S tier motion sensor is a decent Gadget especially for solo queue but in a team setting there's often better gadgets available for you to use getting alerted to where players are is helpful but it can't really be used offensively like the tracking darts or the sonar grenade which is really where it tends to not do as well it's still decent and a pretty good pick for solo key players and I'd place it in the B tier as it's definitely a situational but still pretty good Gadget with the Nerf to explosive mines pyrro mine has taken the top spot for the best landmines in my opinion they do solid enough damage and I often like to put them on statues to at least somewhat punish defibs you also get to start with two which is more than what you can say for the explosive of Minds at the moment I plac them in the B tier despite its many Nerfs that it has received over time the C4 remains a staple pick for the heavy Loadout and this is mainly for one particular reason to delay the cash out remotely so you can afford to play further away almost every top player you ask is going to say that this is a must pick for the heavy class and having the C4 ready to drop a cash out really can be a GameChanger just make sure you knock over the cash out on top of it so that nobody can shoot or glitch it I'm going to put it in the a tier the anti-grab cube is a bit of an unfortunate Gadget it's not really good at anything except for being able to move cash outs around in combination with the winch claw it can also technically stall a cash out but this can be pretty easily countered by a heavy using mes Shield or you can just shoot the cube i' place it in the C tier barricade has fallen off a little bit as of late but it's still pretty decent a lot more teams are opting for goo lately as they cover a lot more distance and can't be dematerialized the barricade does tend to be able to be maneuvered around a little bit more easily in combat situations it's an okay pick that will go into the B tier jump pad has remained one of the most popular picks for the medium class for good reason being able to give your team free height and Escape Route or just movement in general is not only fun but also extremely valuable not to mention these silly things you can do with it like bouncing cash outs easily an S tier Gadget another very useful Gadget similar to the jump pad the zipline has longer range and can help you get to locations quickly but it is a little easier to shoot people on it so do be aware of that it's even better when you combine it with the jump pad to get some insane movement it can also be considered an stier option one of the most powerful things in a game that focuses on abilities and utility is taking away those things and the glitch trap does just that it's also a good counter to the triple medium defib chains that have become much more common recently making it an a tier Gadget data reshaper is one of those gadgets that will either be super helpful or borderline useless depending on the team that you're facing turning turrets into harmless potted plants will always be funny being able to cycle through different arena carbles is also a little bit underrated but if the enemy teams aren't running anything that can be reshaped this ends up being mostly a wasted perk slot I'd place it in the B tier for this season okay let's be honest here for a second even someone with two hours in the game will probably figure out very quickly that defib is probably the most powerful Gadget in the game right now being able to revive a player basically for free at a bit of an HP cost is super helpful and it's hard to counter these things unless you completely decimate the enemy team or actively dedicate Gadget slots to counter it such as with the glitch trap easily one of the best if not the best gadget in the game right now is going into the S tier APS is kind of similar to the data reshaper in that it is something that is very dependent on the other team's Loadout if nobody is running throwable utility or grenade launchers the aps is pretty much useless however that's not going to happen very often because so many things in this game are throwables and because things like RPG frag grenade and glitch grenade are so popular this thing is going to go into the a tier Gateway is legitimately one of the best pieces of utility in the current state of the game and is something that I almost never take off of the light you can use it to get cash outs quickly and to just improve your pacing in general and it's also very good at allowing your team to defend your cash out much further away than you normally would be able to it is also a really good method to allow your team to push up on opponents without taking any damage which is super helpful in the current Pike meta because Gateway is so good in so many different situations it's going into the S tier glitch grenades is one of those gadgets that is much more valuable in higher level play and a little underwhelming in the lower level lobbies remember how earlier I talked about how good defib and Dome Shield are well this gadget is the counter to those gadgets this thing is super powerful with a coordinated team and I'm going to put it in the a tier stun gun is a gadget that is very good in all skill levels of play but mainly for different reasons in lower ELO being able to drastically reduce your targets movement speed basically to a standstill is really good but if you're not careful a medium or a heavy with good aim and reaction time can still win that DPS battle the part that I personally find the most important in the stun gun is actually the ability to deny specializations and to stop a Cash Out Steel which are all really helpful especially against mes Shield users or heal beam users I'd place this gadget at the top of a tier thermal vision is still in my opinion one of the worst specializations in the game and look I understand using it if you have trouble tracking targets and you use it for accessibility reasons but besides this it's ridiculously Niche and even comes with some drawbacks you can't see mines or gas while it's active which is really a huge oversight in my opinion and the niche strategy of being able to see through smoke and see other invisible lights is really not that great especially when there's other gadgets you could be using that help your team far more I'd place it in the D tier hopefully this thing gets buffed at some point I'd really like for it to be good but it just isn't right now thermal bore is a rarely used but pretty valuable gadget for light it allows you to make openings in walls destroy goo and even get rid of gas and this is all in one Gadget which is honestly really helpful I'd place it in the beer vanish bomb is super helpful for lights on Dash or on grapple who use close- range weapons and need a Quick Escape or a way to sneak up on someone it can really throw people off when the light who was just using cloak earlier now can Dash and being able to cloak your other team members is also really helpful I'd place it in the a tier with the buff to breaching charges allowing you to now hold three at a time you'll basically always have something to destroy a wall with when using this gadget it's great at delaying cash outs like the C4 as well so if your heavy isn't running that you could sort of do that job yourself combine this with the gateway to allow yourself to play a fair ways away from the cash out it's going into the a tier tracking Dart got some much needed changes this season that I think made it a lot more viable having four darts instead of two can give you pretty good uptime on entire enemy teams but it can be a little bit more Niche than the sonar grenade it's an absolutely horrible thing to be hit by this as a light player but it's not that big of a deal if you're playing something like a mes Shield heavy it's still a pretty decent pick either way and I'd place it as a solid B tier option and finally Sona grenade it has its bandages over the tracking Dart mainly because it has the potential to Ping a lot more players and you don't have to be able to see them this alone is often the info that you need and it makes the gadget pretty good in my opinion especially when fights start to get super chaotic I place this in B tier in general but I could see switching off this to use tracking Dart in the final round or if you just have a different kind of play style and that finishes up this list here's everything on it and if you skip to the end just feel free to pause the video here and take a look at it for a minute consider subscribing to the channel for mostly weekly finals videos and I'll see you next time,"The user does not provide specific feedback on the Pike 556 post the 4.2.0 update for 'The Finals'. The discussion revolves around the changes made to the gadgets in the game's season 4. The user shares their ranking from D tier to S tier for the gadgets, but doesn't specifically mention the Pike 556 weapon.

From the feedback, the user appreciates the frag grenade, ranking it as a solid A tier pick due to its high damage and ability to surprise players since there's no grenade indicator in the game. The smoke grenade is viewed as a niche pick, useful for putting out fires and avoiding detection from Zer grenades but the user suggests a buff may be needed to make them more popular, placing it in the C tier.

The flashbang, after recent changes, is now considered more usable with the user appreciating its longer-lasting blindness effect, placing it in the B tier. The gas grenade is considered a niche C-tier pick with the user suggesting it could be more popular if players received two or the duration was increased. The user mentions a gadget called 'ponade' but the feedback was cut off. 

No specific feedback was given on the overall weapon balancing in the game. The Pike 556 after the 4.2.0 update for the game 'The Finals' seems to have received mixed reviews. Its unique ability to slowly destroy goo and damage enemies through walls and ceilings is appreciated by players for its creative utility. However, its damage output is considered subpar, which limits its effectiveness in combat situations. Some players suggested that an increase in damage or additional charges could potentially boost its utility and popularity.

The Pike 556 is compared unfavorably to the Thermal board, which is seen as outperforming it in terms of utility. This places the Pike 556 in the C tier according to the review, indicating that it's seen as a less desirable option in its current state.

The Go Grenade, on the other hand, has seen increased popularity and is considered a meta option, especially for its stall potential. Its ability to create new climbing pathways, trap enemies, and create new angles is highly valued. This places it in the A tier, demonstrating its effectiveness and popularity among players.

The Explosive Mine has received a negative review after the recent nerfs, reducing its effectiveness and rendering it less viable compared to other options like Frag Grenades. It's placed in the C tier due to its dependence on preparation and luck.

The Gas Mine, while effective in creating area denial and performing well in lower levels, is seen as less useful in higher level play, resulting in its placement in the B tier. 

The RPG, despite a nerf, is still The analysis does not provide specific opinions on the pike 556 weapon or its performance after the 4.2.0 update for the game 'The Finals'. The provided information instead discusses the use of various gadgets such as the RPG, motion sensor, pyrro mine, C4, anti-grab cube, and barricade. However, there's no mention of the pike 556 or its balance changes in the update. To provide a detailed opinion on the pike 556 and its performance after the update, specific user reviews, feedback, or data on that specific weapon is required. After the 4.2.0 update of 'The Finals', opinions on the Pike 556 indicate that it is still a decent choice, but it seems to have fallen out of favor compared to other weapons such as the Goo due to its ability to cover more distance and its immunity to dematerialization. The Pike 556 is said to be easily maneuvered around in combat situations and is categorized as a B-tier weapon.

The Jump Pad is still popular among medium class players due to its versatility in providing the team with height advantage, escape routes, and general movement. It is considered an S-tier gadget due to its overall value and the unique tactics it allows, such as bouncing cash outs.

The Zipline, another S-tier gadget, is praised for its long range and quick relocation ability. However, it is noted that players using it are more vulnerable to enemy fire. Combining the Zipline with the Jump Pad for insane movement is highly favored.

Glitch Trap, an A-tier gadget, is appreciated for its ability to counter abilities and utility, making it a powerful asset in the game. It is also a good counter to the increasingly common triple medium defib chains.

The Data Reshaper is a variable gadget, sometimes super helpful and sometimes borderline useless, depending on the team being faced. It can convert turrets into harmless potted plants and can cycle through different arena carbles. However, if the enemy teams don't use any reshaping-affected objects, this gadget Based on the data provided, it appears that the Pike 556 is performing well in the current meta of the game 'The Finals', particularly after the 4.2.0 update. The Gateway, a utility in the game, is particularly effective when used with the Pike 556. It allows the team to defend from a distance and enables the team to push up on opponents without taking any damage. This is very beneficial in the current Pike meta. 

However, the player must be cautious of the stun gun, as it can drastically reduce the target's movement speed and deny specializations, including the ability to stop a Cash Out. It seems to be a potential threat to the Pike 556. 

The APS and glitch grenade, although they can be quite useful depending on the opponent's loadout, they do not seem to have a direct impact on the performance of the Pike 556. 

Overall, the Pike 556 seems to be well balanced within the game and performs well, especially when used in conjunction with certain gadgets. However, player skill and reaction time can still significantly impact its effectiveness. The review does not provide any specific mention of the Pike 556 weapon or its performance after the 4.2.0 update for the game 'The Finals'. The review is primarily focused on the evaluation of different gadgets and their usefulness in the game. 

The detailed opinions about weapon balancing and overall performance of other aspects of the game are as follows:

- The unnamed gadget that is effective against Shield users or heal beam users is highly rated and placed at the top tier.
- The Thermal Vision specialization is considered one of the worst, with limited use cases and significant drawbacks. The reviewer hopes for a future buff to improve its functionality.
- The Thermal Bore gadget is valued for its versatility, including the ability to make openings in walls, destroy goo, and get rid of gas. It's placed in the B tier.
- The Vanish Bomb is lauded for its usefulness for characters using close-range weapons, offering a quick escape or stealthy approach. It's placed in the A tier.
- The buff to Breaching Charges, allowing users to hold three at a time, is appreciated for its utility in wall destruction and delaying cash outs. It's also placed in the A tier.
- The Tracking Dart also received positive feedback due to changes made in the current season, such as increasing the number of darts from two to four, which enhances its viability.

Please provide more information or specific mentions of the Pike 556 and the 4.2.0 update for a more accurate analysis The review does not provide any specific information about the Pike 556 weapon or its performance following the 4.2.0 update for the game 'The Finals'. The discussion is primarily focused on the use of the Sonar Grenade and the Tracking Dart.

The Finals medium class,PaSJNoNkh60,How to be the Medium Player that your teammates will love,so you want to play the medium class maybe it's because you saw how some of the top players play medium and decided that you want to take your gameplay to that level or maybe you've gotten addicted to the movement that the zip line and the jump pad provide you or maybe you just saw the AK-47 and decided yep yep this is this is the class it's been decided whatever the case may be you've come to the right place with this video I'll be giving you all the information that you need so that you can stop your gaml from looking like this here let me get this defib off real quick jump pad there's a guy turret out you're done for it buddy there's two what the what that there's two of them that's not that's not fair as a medium you are playing one of the most versatile classes in the game you're good on attack defense and support but with these advantages comes a large skill Gap that you need to be aware of when you pick this character so to help you climb that skill Gap I'm going to be providing a bunch of tips for every medium specialization throughout this video as well as tips for medium class as a whole and with all that being said let's get started so the very first thing that I'm going to do here is put down this jump pad for my team right here which allows me and in particular my heavy teammate to get very aggressive with the Enemy team I noticed that my Heavy's health bar is getting kind of low and at this time I take a ton of damage so I reposition and heal my heavy so he can take the fight instead I'm also going to do a quick defp on the heavy teammate which is just going to give us a lot more certainty in being able to close out this fight but something that I've noticed is that there there are a lot of people who use defibs at really bad times so I'm going to quickly explain when you should defib and when you should not this is when it's okay to defib if you can gain numbers advantage on the enemy team or at least equal out your team numbers to stall a cash out and divert attention in emergencies and to quickly reset if you expect a third party but there are many times when you should not defib some of these are if someone is already resing if you are unlikely to win the fight even with the defib an instance of this would be if you are in a 1v3 and everybody is at half or more Health if you have to die for the res in some cases this one is okay but 95% of the time dying to get a defib off is a really bad idea and if you are in no danger and you can save it for later treat your defib like a valuable commodity do not waste it so now that I've discussed when you should and shouldn't defib let's go back to the gameplay examples after we've secured this cashbox it's time to put our movement to use again taking height is very important in this game because if you don't have someone else will and medium's utility lets you get that height Advantage very fast I heard some enemy footsteps so I decided to Ping wildly to let my team no to group up if you are playing solo queue and something important like this is happening please use your ping Button as it can really be the difference between you winning that fight and you losing that [Applause] fight one contestant doesn't seem now some of you may have noticed that we are leaving this cash out before it's completed we are doing this because this cash out is honestly almost done and it's highly unlikely that a team steals during this time and before this I had checked the scoreboard and I had seen that all of the teams were actually doing damage which means that they are all fighting over the cash out more than likely however this is where I almost make a crucial mistake not playing with my team it's important to play buyer team when you are a medium or a heavy but especially as a heal beam when I realize my mistake I immediately go to regroup with my heavy who can hopefully protect me my heavy decided to dome shield in and go for the cash out but instead of healing him the whole time like a lot of mediums would I Instead try to kill the people shooting at him there's a time into place for healing but if you can outright kill an opponent it's better to do that instead of just healing King them and hoping that they survive after I deposited this cash out I noticed that D already has a fair bit of progress on it and it's close by that means there's the potential for us to be able to take both cash outs and if we could pull that off that would be a huge Advantage but before I push in I try to get some opening damage from long range and wait for my heavy to push in ahead of me when you're the healbe medum you want to try to be the Last One Alive as often as possible as he takes the cash out I'm going to watch to make sure that nobody tries to kill him while he takes it once again this medium shows up near the end of the Steal but because the cash out is nearly stolen I go to heal instead of kill after I whiff some really easy shots here I go to defib the heavy in case of a third party now here is a very important decision making moment when I go over to push up on this cash box I notice that the timer is nearly up and both of my teammates are busy fighting so if we want to take this box I have to act now luckily my teammates were able to body block for me and we were able to take it so while you as a heal beam medium probably shouldn't be the one taking the cash box in certain Niche scenarios like this you just might have to do it anyways also if this video has been helpful consider leaving it a like as it really does help me out a ton and if you like the sound of mostly weekly finals videos consider subscribing it's okay I can wait okay I'm done now let's get back to the video in this game I'm in a triple medium team and I'm playing with dematerializer with dmat you can afford to play a little bit more aggressively and a little bit more like a light player because you don't have to worry about healing your teammates so I'm going to be pretty front and center in a lot of these fights I see that the heavy has put up a barricade and is playing behind it so I decide to pressure him with the dmat my teammate manages to take down the heavy but then goes down but instead of getting the defibr I leave that to the other more support focused medium in my team and try to go and finish off the light once again I'm going to give my team a little bit of movement so we can deposit the cash box faster and then we're going to to take height it's actually a much better idea to not hold the cash boox on the moving platform but instead to follow it around from High Ground if you get this specific event instead of chasing this team across and trying to kill them we are going to take this zip line all the way to the top of Apartments where we will be able to hold a much better position and can use our movement gadgets to quickly rotate to the platform if necessary if this team doesn't want to get jump padded on top of they're going to have to challenge us while we have the positioning Advantage at this point I go into get aggressive with my dmat and get their attention and some opening damage but then I rotate out with my jump pad and let my teammates clean up after we finish this fight we're going to use the zipline to once again rotate over to the next building and be ready for another fight if necessary and sure enough pink team is going for the Cash Out station so I decide to drop down and keep them from stealing the cash out even if it means that I end up dying I managed to stop them from stealing with my aggressive play and while they are focused on dealing with me my teammates are able to get some pretty free damage on so this next engagement is a really good example of how you should play dmat around cash out a lot of dmat players would like to drop the cash out immediately upon depositing the cash box but this isn't a great idea here I'm going to hold the high ground with the rest of my team to try and stop the enemy before they even reach the cash out here by playing below the cash out instead of above it I can drop it down and stall for longer and possibly isolate A3 V1 if I also manage to get one of the opponents then me and my team are going to rotate to the floor below again to do the exact same thing here pink team finds us and takes a fight but because we aren't playing in the room with the cash boox we are limiting our chances of being attacked by a third party after I whiff some of my shots I go and defit my teammate instead of slow resing because I hear footsteps and I expect that I will need to drop the cash out immediately some other ways that you can use the dmat is by playing very aggressively with it and cutting off opponents who might be running away from you [Music] at the time of recording this video turret is easily the worst specialization you can use for medium unless you play terminal attack however if you still want to use it I do have a few tips for you on how you can maximize your turret efficiency be careful about some of the materials that you place your turrets on for instance these ceilings on Soul tend to break really e easily and if your turret falls down from them it's pretty much useless a lot of players expect you to place your turrets near the cash out but if you do this too much it can become predictable and your turrets lose a lot of their value FX it up once in a while by placing it in an area away from the cash out where you can either fall back to or play from to catch the Enemy by surprise another example of good turret placement is this clip right here where I placed it in a space that will cover either staircase from the enemy that they could push up from Once the turret does some opening damage I Engage The Enemy while they are distracted to get a quick kill I also tend to notice a lot of turret medium players like to sit by their turret at all times you don't need to do this and this actually limits you a lot don't be afraid to push enemies and then when they chase you go run back to where your turret is placed to make them really choose between whether they want to keep pushing you or if they want to back up and not deal with that turret something else that I do to mix things up as well is placing my turret in one area for the first fight at a cash out and then moving it after that fight is finished to be much closer to the cash out this usually really catches my opponents off guard and can be a great way to mix up your strategy but besides these tips just play turret medium in a similar way to the dematerialize your medium and you should be fine and those are a bunch of ways that you can be a better medium player now all of these things can be quite a lot to take in so if you feel overwhelmed by all this information just try focusing on one thing at a time until you've mastered that and then move on to the next thing I really hope that this video was helpful and entertaining and if it was consider giving it a like as it really does help out the channel and consider subscribing for mostly weekly videos on the finals and with that I'll see you in the next one [Music],"The review doesn't provide specific feedback on the Pike 556 after the 4.2.0 update.

The Finals medium class,81CpaQSUMG8,How to Win More with Medium Class – The Finals Pro Tips,medium is the most used Class in the finals right now I think and after close to 650 hours in the game I want to share the things I've learned Ming medium and high level lobbies but before you jump in the arena make sure you know what you're up against one of the things I like to do is check the leaderboard before getting into the game this way I know which classes I'm up against and I can choose my counter weapons and gadgets if I see a lot of lights in my Lobby for example I'll choose between the F card the revolver or the model 1887 because I counter best lights with those weapons one of the most interesting things I found about this game is how Embark managed to make the medium a support class while also acting as an assault class you can do just as much damage if not more than a heavy or light while still supporting your team more than they can this brings me to the heal beam I've seen a lot less medium players use the heal beam after their season 4 Nerf but it's still an extremely powerful tool for the medium class I'm sure we've all been against a three medium heal beam circle jerk before I'm back circle jerk circle jerk circle jerk circle jerk circle jerk but remember you don't always have to be aggressive as medium you can hang back with the heal beam and watch the show I'm healing you bro I'm healing you bro I'm healing you bro it's all you bro nice another thing you can do with the heal beam is the body block heal Strat that I'm sure you've all encountered before which is also really good for the last second steals but hey if you're not a heal beam guy that's okay with me you have to find the best specializations and gadgets that fit your play style I personally like to stay alive as long as I can so I've been using a lot of things to keep me alive like the goo grenade and dematerializer as of recent Staying Alive while dealing damage to your opponents helps your team a lot because even if you can't finish someone off on your own your team is there to help you and if one of your teammates go down you can defib someone and keep them alive speaking of staying alive make sure you're using your movement and gadgets to outplay your opponents this is especially useful when fighting in buildings cuz the enemies never expect a window jump when I'm being chased utilize your gadgets use Goo or grenades or flashbangs whatever you need to help stay alive this kind of goes for every class but let's say you aren't running the right gadgets or you ran out well using the canisters around the map is extremely underrated I've gotten out of so many situations where I should have died but a trusty goo canister or red canister was there to save my life when I should have very easily died for all you AR users make sure you learn The Recoil pattern of your gun with that said I don't even fully know the recoil pattern of every gun I have the memory of a goldfish but I do remember the F car pattern because all the bullets do is go up to the right slightly this one was very easy to learn for me and with the season 4 update allowing me to remove the scope the F car has become a lot more satisfying to use so before jumping into a game check out the patterns in the practice range or do what I do and just shoot a wall when you join a game for a quick reminder of The Recoil pattern remember that Medium is a support class so if you're the type of player that likes defending cash outs then don't be sleeping on the mines sometimes you can get away with some pretty ridiculous things a man uh on that the will have to oh my God oh my oh my no [ __ ] way dude that's wild that is insane the glitch mine is still very powerful despite its season 4 Nerf you only get one but you can place two on the map once it's done charging up throwing a glitch mine on a statue is a great counter to other mediums and it's one of the most frustrating things they can encounter going for a defib on your teammate and being glitched and switched to your primary weapon is not a good time team coordination is huge in this game and I I get it solo cubing is tough but try to find someone you played well with and AD them having your team all push someone is easily one of the best ways to win and having coordination and trying out different things may surprise not just your team but you as well you're going to jump head up break through the window and place two turrets all right okay here hold on hold on wa wait so I'm going to place this jump Pad Place the turrets then we're going to go around over that side and you're going to jump P okay yeah yeah all right okay let's go turret jump drop all right now come back there I a jump pad right here moving follow go flank oh my God please oh my God oh my God what the [ __ ] dude so there you have it that's how you use medium get creative use your movement and support skills to your advantage keep your team alive and have some fun if you enjoyed the video consider leaving a like And subscribe for more finals content also leave a comment below if you found some tips and tricks you want to share

specific feedback about the pike 556 weapon after the 4.2.0 update for the game 'The Finals'. It appears that the player found the gameplay confusing and challenging, particularly when faced with opponents using different weapons. The player also mentions a situation where they were taken by surprise by an invisible enemy who used a shotgun, suggesting potential issues with game balancing or stealth mechanics. No direct opinions or comments about the performance or balancing of the pike 556 after the update were clearly stated. It seems like the provided text is a transcript of a gaming session, but it's hard to extract detailed opinions about the Pike 556 weapon after the 4.2.0 update due to lack of direct references. However, there are some indirect inferences about the medium class and gameplay:

1. The players discuss the high damage output of a certain weapon or player, saying ""he just one shot me basically"". Whether this refers to the Pike 556 isn't clear, but it indicates the perceived power of some weapons or players.
2. They mention getting ""tagged"" through the floor, which could imply some dissatisfaction with the game physics or a particular weapon's ability to shoot through surfaces.
3. There are comments about the difficulty of dealing with certain opponents, such as ""I cannot get that guy"" and ""he's so low"". This might suggest that the Pike 556 or other weapons might not be balanced for dealing with all types of opponents.
4. The players seem to have some issues with the game's mechanics or balance, with comments like ""what is UN doing half half that's actually embarrassing for me"", which could refer to some imbalance or unexpected behavior in the game.
5. There are indications of challenges in team coordination, such as ""where are you going teammate"", which could be related to the game's communication or team mechanics rather than the Pike 556 itself.

In conclusion, without direct references to the Pike 556, it's hard to form a solid Based on the text given, the player seems to be facing issues with the Pike 556 medium class. The player is frustrated, indicating that the weapon might not be as effective as they would like. They mention having to reload often, and their shots not doing as much damage as they would like. The player also mentions their kills are being stolen, suggesting that the Pike 556 may not be dealing enough damage to quickly eliminate enemies. 

However, it is important to note that the player mentions having a high combat score, suggesting that they are still able to effectively use the Pike 556 in combat situations, but perhaps not as efficiently as they would like. 

After the 4.2.0 update, it appears the Pike 556 may not be as balanced compared to other weapons in the game, causing some frustration among the players. However, this is a subjective opinion and more data would be needed to confirm this.

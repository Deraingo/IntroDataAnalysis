The Finals game gameplay,j0o30KGEAQo,The Finals Is a MASTERPIECE!,"this shooter is one of the best in 2024 and yet hardly anybody is talking about it I feel like this game needs so much more attention than what it is actually getting welcome to the finals a team-based firstperson shooter with a game show vibe to it kind of like Hunger Games if you remember the game radical Heights which had a brief window of existence it gives me some of those vibes with the way the announcers are talking and kind of over the top with some of it so it's already in a fun setting but this game was developed by Embark Studios whose CEO was actually in charge of dice of course the creators of Battlefield until 2018 so that doesn't include 2042 don't worry but of course with a new Battlefield game on the horizon this could be a good game to experience in order to scratch some of that itch before we get it or potentially even completely replace it for you because this is not really competing directly with a battlefield style of game but does have a lot of elements that you would immediately recognize on top of that the game is extremely well received Steam Reviews can be notoriously harsh but man this is a mostly positive and a lot of people have a lot of great things to say on this for good reason of course we don't know the player counts on Playstation Xbox everything exactly but from my understanding there's 400,000 daily active users when the game first came out though it had its record Peak specifically on Steam over 200,000 players dwindled down quite a bit but it just had a massive boom season 4 of this game recently released and it was definitely highly anticipated now one of the biggest selling points for this game is just how destructive the maps are this is that bit that I think you will recognize from Battlefield and I think this goes even crazier with a wide variety of rocket launchers grenades even plan mines that you can use on top of sledgehammers you can charge through walls on this the cat ropic damage that then completely collapses buildings on top of each other and you could even use to blow a hole in the wall and pull an objective through it or drop it down a floor in order to make a crazy play if you enjoy some of the Levolution elements that are in Battlefield while it's not as crazy of a massive scale for it there is still so much destruction if you see a zip line up you could just break it that route is gone that alone makes a whole another skill Gap that you could make incredible plays with but the way this game is designed is in three base classes that are based on weight there's the light class who focuses on speed overpower they're the only class that can have a sniper rifle very small hit box obviously and their weapons can be devastating but don't have much health and can die very quickly but if you like speed their Dash ability their cloaking where you can go invisible aculite was making some plays with this that were just mind-blowing including standing right next to an objective nobody could see them if you're standing perfectly St it's like you're invisible you you actually can be there's the heavy which is kind of your classic tank build obviously much easier to hit because it's huge moves slower but is also flush with so much health and some good Firepower although most of it's close range with even some heavy melee bring some range Firepower with an RPG this is typically the guy who's breaking holes in walls you can slam into it's it's crazy you can also carry an extra weapon which can be a huge Advantage depending on what kit you want to take and I'll get to some of that in a second but the last one is the medium class which is the main one that I've been playing kind of feels like you're just standard shooter class which is mostly what I was going for with it especially being relatively new to the game I played it a lot during the beta but multiple reasons I might get into here I ended up moving away from it for a while you can also take on more of a support type of role which I always love being a field Medic in Battlefield you can literally be the healer for the squad but the nice thing amongst all of these kits is that there's a lot of flexibility you're not choosing a specific person or operator that you're taking on this class and character and listen to their same voice lines all the time you just choose that weight and then you can have any build that you want within this you basically have four equipment slots with a whole range of different equipment some being similar between the light and medium or heavy and medium which I think makes everything simpler when you're kind of choosing what to play and just figuring the game out cuz you don't need to remember a whole bunch of different characters names and classes and all all that stuff the game modes is where we saw an interesting curveball that I think split the community on this game though there's four basic different modes that are in the game terminal attack was one of the newer ones which caused it this is your attack and defend mode only one life of essentially your Search and Destroy One Life per round this is not how the game was initially created or hyped up or anything and in season 3 the previous one they had completely shifted the game where this was the ranked game that you played was kind of nice because there's more people per team and to me it kind of showed the flexibility that the development team has to even be able to completely shift their game at least I did not see this being the direction that the game went they had some other newer modes that they had added Powers shift was one where you're on moving platforms across the map with the more people on the platform from your team the faster that it moves platforms even bust through obstacles breaking things down first team to bring the platform back to their base wins it's very fast-pace mode which is more what this game is around including Bank it where you open vaults to get coins but in order to count those you have to actually go somewhere and Bank it throw the money in the Box defend it until it's secured which is the main one that we played is cash out where you have to go open a vault grab the cash bring it to a deposit and then defend this point once the timer runs out whoever owns the point gets all of the cash so you could go in at the last second steal that point and then get all of the reward for it which we actually got an incredible win from but within all of these modes the big catch with it of course around the name of the game the finals is that you're trying to make it to the finals it gives you some of that Rush of what you would get from a battle royale where you know you go in with 150 people and it comes down to one team winning but in a little bit more of a controlled scenario of course a tournament you go through three rounds two qualifiers and then one finale against the last other team standing which then to me makes it even more competitive than what a battle royale even feels like especially for the rank side of things which I'll touch on in a second so with season 4 they brought back this competitive mode of the actual proper tournaments the Crazy fast-pace Action that is the game not instantaneous respawns and limited number of lives as you go but still quite fast-paced and aggressive game in addition to the typical battle pass you see from a game like this you also have three different sponsor tracks and I haven't even mentioned this yet but this game is free to play it's available crossplay for PC Xbox PlayStation there's no pay to win in it the game play itself is so smooth it's doing something different outside of a couple of crashes that I experienced the first couple of Seasons that I had played all of my experience the last couple days that I've been on have been incredible no crashes issues when I asked my buddies to play and they wanted to actually hop on for this I was I was thinking about this for days and the main thing that was bringing us back was this season 4 change they brought back the tournaments and this competitive fast flowing field to the game that was more the design of when initially came out and they kind of shifted away from for season 3 for ranked but not everybody even plays ranked anyways but it seems like this is their focus again their unique modes that they've created there's a separate event where you can get additional just free Cosmetics you have challenges that you can complete throughout the season they have a completely new map called Fortune Stadium which is sweet too because they even have different times of day and alterations to some of the maps that occur in addition to some insane events that happened during the game just completely up to luck they added three new weapons which seemed extremely powerful I will say the pike was nuts essentially we were in a DMR meta it took me embarrassingly long to realize that it was basically hit scan as well I'm over here trying to lead my shots half the time I was using it there was a whole bunch of balance changes as well so they're shifting up the game as you would expect in a season pass but good to see I also saw that they added a beard customization for it which I was a fan of I think that was new for this season big fan of that so with all these positives what is it that's keeping players away and I don't completely know the answer to it I'm curious of what you guys think about this if you've been playing it in love with it why isn't you know maybe even friends of yours don't want to hop in if you do love the game or if you don't what's the biggest detriment to you one of the things that I think I've realized playing it is how competitive the game is I will say we were doing the world tour which is kind of like a casual mode to the ranked where you go through a tournament but it's not for rank but even in that man it was insane of course I'm just going to show you the highlights fortunately I didn't die to fall damage the whole time of course there's no fall damage in the game but you can fall off of a map but dude it is crazy and even in the Casual mode that's just like one game where it's not going through rounds you still have 20 seconds to wait between respawn because obviously you have to balance out the Healer and the reses with the defibrillators and because this is a very team oriented game you really need coordination for it and I just am not a fan of playing games like that with randoms which is why I was so excited to have my friends play with me you really want to have a full Trio for it and a lot of times I'll just enjoy playing games solo my buddy Tom did mention they had a solo mode I never got to experience that it's not in the game currently I think it is quite difficult for a game like this I saw the same thing with Apex Legends I loved actually when they made the solo mode for Apex way back in the day they maybe brought it back a couple times since then but I know that's at least deterrent for me and I didn't even mention this yet but man I got to praise their Cosmetics they are so sick they've got like third person animations that are emotes that you could also use as like your Victory pose it's not just a victory pose you get you can use it in game in addition to firstperson animations you can do full sprinting inspects of your weapons your entire character you buy a bundle from the store and instead of it just being one item that that's the only thing you can wear it's it's more individualized like what fortnite does where you've got a back bling that it might come with a lower and an upper one you can change out just the Torso or just the legs to make some super wacky weird outfit or something sick because you combine two things that came from different packs but would work well together from it like you could put glasses on a watch even have a pet on your back like the customization level on this is just incredible which I think might also deter some people where they're realizing okay this is where I'm going to have to end up spending all the money I can't get a lot of stuff for free here but there is a free battle pass and they're now doing some events in the game that have additional tracks the sponsor track here and while some of them are a bit wacky I think it's more within the theme of this game being a giant game show and for fun and entertainment versus something like war zone which is a a war and Military and then there's you know a catthe headed person running around or Snoop Dog that's actually a dog but with all of that in mind and especially right now over the next month where we've kind of got this L before Black Ops 6 comes out a lot of people not even interested that maybe even just waiting for war zone to launch with season one of it or looking for something new in general I feel like this is one of the best times to even look at or get into this game I feel like this is one that maybe just maybe it hasn't got enough marketing maybe not enough people even know about it I feel like it is such an underrated game for what is being delivered here and how good it is it also does have a very loyal and active following with it but it felt like it just needed a little extra praise and attention after playing it and checking it out I wanted to do this video on it just for the sake of experiencing the map destruction itself is like the first game that I went in I was just like it's just it blows you away man it's so cool and what's also very crazy if you're more into the extraction Shooters which I've been talking on quite a bit lately the same developers are actually planning to release a third person extraction game called Arc Raiders this is supposedly going to be a pvpve game coming out in 2025 on Xbox PC and Playstation this also has some futuristic Vibes to it where you have to fight robots and drones as well as of course each other unlike the finals though Arc Raiders is not planned to be free to-play but I don't think that's something I can say is a positive or negative for the game yet and if it's anywhere near as fun as the finals is and like how polished well put together unique it is for it I'm I'm eager to see how it goes and what people think of it as well speaking of which let me know in the comments make sure you're subscribed if you enjoy all these videos you can check out my streams that are live on this channel as well every single weekday let me know what you think in person but that's it for this one thanks so much for watching Stone Mount 64 over and out","Opinions on Weapon Balancing:
The game offers a wide variety of weapons including rocket launchers, grenades, clay mines, and sledgehammers. The player appreciates the variety and the destructiveness of each weapon, especially with the ability to cause catastrophic damage to the game environment. However, the review does not provide specific feedback on the balancing of these weapons.

Overall User Opinions:
The overall opinion on the game is overwhelmingly positive. The user praises the game for its unique team-based, first-person shooter concept that includes elements reminiscent of the Hunger Games and Radical Heights. The game setting is described as fun and over-the-top, which seems to contribute to its appeal. 

The game has been well-received by the wider gaming community as well, as indicated by the mostly positive reviews on Steam. The player count is also substantial, with over 200,000 players on Steam alone at its peak. There's also excitement about the game's new releases, with Season 4 being highly anticipated.

The destructibility of the game's maps was highlighted as a significant selling point, offering players the ability to cause widespread damage with the array of weapons available. 

Despite its positive aspects, the user also notes that the game is currently underappreciated and deserves more attention than it's currently receiving. The lack of conversation around the game is a point of concern. The analysis reveals that the players appreciate the game's destructible environment. This includes elements such as building destruction and the ability to break a zip line, which can significantly alter the gameplay. This feature is seen as a skill gap that can lead to incredible plays.

The game's class-based design, which consists of light, heavy, and medium classes, is well received. The light class is liked for its speed and devastating, yet fragile nature, with special abilities like dashing and becoming invisible. The heavy class is appreciated for its tank-like characteristics, having a lot of health, close-range firepower, and the ability to carry an extra weapon. The medium class is seen as the standard shooter class and is liked for its versatile nature.

However, the game's weapon balancing seems to be a matter of concern. The light class's weapons, although devastating, are seen as a possible balance issue due to the class's small hitbox and low health. The heavy class's weapons, mainly close-range, are appreciated, but it's highlighted that it lacks long-range firepower, except for an RPG. The medium class's weapons are not discussed in detail.

The text also mentions the potential to use weapons in unique ways, such as blowing holes in walls, suggesting a level of depth and strategy to the gameplay. However, there is no discussion on whether this is seen as balanced or not.

The overall user opinion about the game is mixed. Some elements are praised, such as the destructible environment and class The user seems to really enjoy the flexibility of the game Battlefield.

However, the user does express some mixed opinions on the game modes. They particularly mention a new mode, Terminal Attack, which they feel has split the community. They explain that this mode, which is an attack and defend mode with only one life per round, is not how the game was initially created or hyped up. Despite this, the user appreciates the flexibility shown by the development team, who were able to shift the game's direction.

Some other new modes the user mentions are Power Shift, which they describe as a fast-paced mode where you move platforms across the map, and Bank It, where you open vaults to get coins. While the user does not explicitly state their opinion on these modes, the detailed description suggests they have spent significant time playing and understanding them.

Overall, the user seems to hold a generally positive opinion of the current state of Battlefield, with a particular appreciation for its flexibility and variety.

They also note that they initially struggled with the weapon, suggesting that it may not be entirely user-friendly or intuitive.

They also commend the unique modes and the addition of events that offer free cosmetics and challenges. The new map, Fortune Stadium, was well-received, with its varying times of day and alterations being a sweet addition.

However, the player also questions why some players may be staying away from the game despite these positives. They speculate that the game's competitive nature could be a deterrent for some players. Despite the game offering a casual mode for ranking, the player still found it highly competitive, which may not appeal to all players. The player also enjoys the beard customization option, indicating a positive reception for character customization in the game. The user has mixed opinions about the game. 

In terms of weapon balancing, the user feels there is a need to balance the Healer and the reses with the defibrillators.

They appreciate the game's theme of being a fun and entertaining game show, distinguishing it from more serious war games. They find the map destruction feature impressive, to the point of it being a key highlight of the game. 

However, they express some frustration about the game's monetization approach, noting that it's hard to acquire a lot of stuff without spending money, despite the presence of a free battle pass and in-game events. 

They are also excited about the game's future developments, including the planned release of a third person extraction game by the same developers. Yet, there's an implicit concern that unlike the current game, the new one won't be free to play.

However, no specific details or criticisms about the game's mechanics or balance are mentioned."

Vault pretty solid fight there shouldn't have surrendered the height you see I went from here this little height here I went from here down to here to get the Vault and that was the moment they came over here they took the ground GG you see that this is a it's a game of numbers you got to maintain the numbers you you got to remain 3v2 you got to keep your life and sometimes if you make a decision like that where Unfortunately they they have the advantage over you you're going to be down the numbers and you're going to lose the game I'm simply put Lads this is not and and what have I just said though I just said and what I just ignored this is not the environment for a dematerializer it simply means nothing right now big grenades gone in there I'm so weak I would love a healing beam in my

there's no steals here we're chilling get rid of that be hi me to punch let's leave the light player his old magic downstairs shall we we're going to jump pad here cuz if it all falls down is that right will it go flying can I get that on that I don't think I can it's GG though it's GG the movement coming in strong as you said boys it is all to play for guys wipe us wipe us boys wipe us it literally doesn't matter we are inevitable beautiful for the rest great M there it is and that's a wipe the boy is furious but fundamentally it doesn't matter cuz when it comes down to it Lads who's in the lead pride comes before a fall ladies and gentlemen pride comes before a fall we must we must remain calm this is not going to be easy these guys are not McKing around there oh I mean the zip lines and the jump pads are essential on a map like this cuz every sing every every singy what every single Cash Out point is uh floating in the sky I can't believe I ever doubted you L especially with I mean with suspender structures I agree I think in the ones that are enclosed less so are they up here like I would be oh God get him away get him away from me boys let's hit a big Big Res there there he is I just seen someone down there I don't know everyone's dead are they he's dead again let's get air let's go for it we're all in on the res I got you we're all in on that res baby everyone I fight is full Shields like everybody I fire is full Shields oh God it's not looking good is it boys what do you suggest we do now oh God okay well let him get it we can always steal again another situation where we're just up high the boys are down low in the in the absolute trenches not a lot of tactical thinking coming in but a lot of energy will it work in the end who knows the thing is it's all these these ones there's no Heavies right there's no Heavies so these suspended structures are likely to stay in the air it's a very different game when that's the case if they're heavy they just get brought down but now that it's all kind of up in the air if you will this you've done what you've grenade launched me no just running down low towards them again I mean just hold on a seconding CL stay with me stop fighting like what is this what is the strategy stay as low as humanly possible I have a zip line so an enemy there there's an enemy on you boy if you're aware of this get him big now it's going to get game of numbers boys going for the rest there it is oh down low easy he's in here there will be no res what happened to me I don't know I think it was a frag grenade kill it was world class what it was that got must be looking for the res you must it's a game of numbers you must re you must Focus re what are we doing getting Shields back must Focus res there it is there it is 3 okay not looking good oh it's looking like it could have gone well there for a moment that's GG I don't we going to have time to contest this like this one are we I don't know what the strategy of running down low is lad's just running through here like what are we like like objectively speak look at this look at the scene you're thinking yes this is the one just go up here go around the side we've got that kill that was big again we again we it's always two of us never three of us we're never together it's a very simple thing just got to group up like just stay together and you can do anything but I'm seeing a lot of stray Behavior we've got no assist between us look at the assists on the other team four four and three we have three max oh I'm dead I'm dead looking at stats I'm dead also seeing the absolute two is interesting here cuz the first one we saw how powerful my movement stuff was look on that one there we saw how powerful the uh get him boys he's weak clean him up there It Is Res is in there it is I'm dead he's dead oh he's away taking damage there he goes scurrying offen the problem with the sword is very very unlikely that you're going to get a lot of use out of it on a on a suspended structures map like this cuz so much of it is ranged fights you're just always up against it he has got three kills not so bad the other team's got 10 that guy with the uh with the old model there doing the work definitely a good weapon for this situation well they've got the Vault still all to play for it's going to come down to the last Cash Out point which is what we like to call in the industry squeaky bum time if I'm going to have to just be I'm going to have to just follow them the problem is I've I've not been able to follow them because where I'm following them is into certain death so I have to change course like here I went there cuz I normally say we'll just go with the team if there be a mad lad just go with but in that scenario hang on a minute I didn't see that that had happened he switched to wait what he's got riot shield is he turn on situation thought riot shield was a primary weapon he has a Famas no I thought he had a Famas can you switch after deaths in World Tour wait what so you can switch then can you we just watched the kill Camy out of Famas that grenade just destroy me what I tell you what did I tell you

moments I can change load out mid game I honestly don't think you could do that this is news to me and he went for a riot shield it's very interesting as a choice I don't want to point fingers but I mean we with I'm looking at this and two melee in an in an open map like this not healing beam no no not healing beam riot shield that'll do it right I'm GNA get a triple kill and win this game it's happening right now that's the only thing left for it they're not even looking at the cash out they're just getting absolutely destroyed by this guy going have to go out the back here try and evade

Adam very good I think that grapple needs to be sped up a little bit really maneuverable though nice view for the Big Splash that was a good explosive Barrel here I want to test this so you could use that as cover someone was chasing you you could just throw that area denial you know come here panda okay oh look how that building is completely different to what it was like a minute ago chunks taken out of it now Mega damage just more bullet damage there maybe it doubled it or something it's daytime on the same map now visibility is a lot better here damn I've got an AK as well [Applause] oh wow that is a lot of goo I wish I had my RPG God reminds me so much of sand Crossing you know the BF3 map AK feels pretty good hope that I can get Red Dot sights for the guns with a customization would be cool it feels like oh hello oh my God there's three mine grenade oh yes right I tried to use every piece of utility there that I had yeah Red Dot size would be good every gun that I've used so far has had iron sights on it not that they're bad but yeah it just adds a bit of variety doesn't it if you've got different sites you can use I'm gonna chase that dude where did you go oh you said lovely yeah this AK is great okay this time I built someone who's got a dagger and a grapple so kind of like an assassin class I think it is a one-hit kill yeah I just got a couple of Hello Panda goodbye yeah that's definitely a one-hit kill that was a heavy right well that's very effective it's one of the bloody hell's up in there the entire building is gone this is just absolute chaos I'll test out this knife a bit more oh one two three four five right so it's only one hit kill in the back then so it's kind of like the Spy class from Team Fortress 2. guys check this out I have a flamethrower us pull ahead I think someone else does as well done oh you don't like that do you panda I'm broke smash boom wait did I just smash through the door then you can do that oh he smashed me back no I like being the heavy oh look they put some Shields up here where'd you go oh deleted stay away this is our cash out are you again panda come here give me that there's so many things that I have to think about and I have to reload yes hello did you just spawn there come on let's go let's go yeah you like that C4 come chase me don't chase me see what happens I know you're gonna burn bye it's a heavy off I feel like this flamethrower doesn't really do enough damage come on yes that's revenge for smashing me before what why is this here there's an elevator I can pick which floor can I what's the point of this when I can just smash it jump out jump down I want you boom Oh my God so I'm gonna take the cash out box and then go through the floor in the hole I've made put it in the station and that's gonna start scoring points try and defend it lucky there double explosion you again no it's getting a bit crazy now they're trying to steal it from us smash yes run right through him it's good I got the zip line here that's rapid I'll pick the turret here too see how good it is that's nearly capped Queen poisonous gas stuff so we'll try oh hello is that a shield there's all sorts of different things that you can get right okay so we're gonna go back to the cash out over here I think put it down there oh is this guy again with a shield doesn't protect your back at all that can't do anything with that so apparently if you get in the cab at this you can move the crane around this thing here look I can rotate it so if part of them up gets destroyed too much I can come up here get in the cab control it and then if I jump up we can use that to move across the level across that giant Gap there like if I didn't have a zip line or something that's the way that I would have to get across interesting for the pink team are cashing out here so we're gonna try and stop them but we need to oh my God there's a turret there are they good me off how are we gonna get in here try and grenade it and my toe is going on look floor's gone and I was doing it stop that hey I'm the one who views yes right that was sweet can I steal it I can steal it now hopefully my teammates cover Mega damage is on to mine the floor's gone the mind is still there everything's exploding why not throw some more a bit everything's good now it's a frag can't seem to destroy those mines that's weird we're going down C4 he's gone down again oh wait what the cash out machine dropped down then foreign it actually dropped down the level when the floor exploded yeah look we're on a different level now take it oh my god wow all right that was really interesting look it's completely changed that's where it was and now it's down here that was awesome and we got the win DG yeah this is last round I've gone back to the heavy guy with the auto shotty feel like this is my favorite loadout did the other guy you're invisible in here where are you oh there you are sneaky I've got some good

The Finals weapon balancing,SWlUqVs-f7Y,SEASON 3 WEAPON STATS: FCAR | THE FINALS,the final season 3 meta weapons the fcar a full auto assault rifle for the medium class it deals 22 body damage and 33 critical damage it has a maximum fire rate of 600 rounds per minute delivered from a 25 round mag that takes 1.8 seconds to reload time to kill against a light player is 682 milliseconds for body shots and 455 Ms if you hit head shot against a medium ttk is 1136 Ms for body shots and 758 Ms for head shot finally for heavy ttk is 1591 Ms for body shots and 1061 Ms for critical hits follow for more,"Opinions about Weapon Balancing: 

There seems to be a general consensus that the FCAR, a full auto assault rifle for the medium class, could be better balanced in terms of its damage output. With 22 body damage and 33 critical damage, some players feel that the weapon may be too powerful in terms of its damage output. Additionally, its high fire rate of 600 rounds per minute and a relatively short reload time of 1.8 seconds could potentially make it an overpowered choice. However, the time to kill (TTK) against various player types does provide some balance - with a TTK of 682 milliseconds for light players, 1136 milliseconds for medium players, and 1591 milliseconds for heavy players. 

Overall User Opinions on the Current State of the Game: 

The final season 3 meta weapons, including the FCAR, are generally well-received by the player base. However, some concerns about weapon balancing, particularly in relation to the FCAR's damage output and fire rate, are prevalent. Despite these concerns, the varying TTK against different player types is appreciated as it adds an element of strategy and skill to the game. Players seem to be eagerly awaiting more information and updates about the game."

The Finals weapon balancing,r-QdqIFRGNA,I Used EVERY Heavy Weapon In The Finals! BEST &amp; Worst Build - ELHOMO,how's it going folks in today's video we're going to run back the same challenge as last week except instead of using all the medium weapons we'll be using all the heavy weapons all right so for those of you who are new to the channel this is a series where I try out each and every weapon from a particular build and then rank each of the weapons from best to worst based on their PVP performance in the banket game mode purely off of KD ratio now I know that some of you would prefer an all-rounded ranking going more in depth into the objective based performance of the weapons and so on so just note that this video is meant to rate only how the guns Faire in a PBP aspect in doing this challenge I will be purposefully trying to extend the duration of each match so that I can Pub stomp with the weapons to try and drop as many kills as possible now without any more explaining the first weapon on our list is the flamethrower I was very surprised by the performance of this gun while doing the challenge the flamethrower absolutely Cooks in close- range fights and was very effective in chaotic scenarios I personally play with a top rated EU Diamond heavy who would stand by the opinion that the flamethrower is a devious weapon in this game and it is very fun to use I found in the game that I used for that the enemies were just scared to face it and it actually causes them to panic rather than shoot back anyways the obvious flaw is its range but anyone with a 10 plus IQ knows that you just need to close the distance before engaging this thing scored US 24 eliminations with only five deaths giving us a 4.8 KD ratio and ranking in at the top of the list for this challenge I know that's going to surprise some of you Lewis gun and M60 players but that's just how the games went for me here anyways moving on to the ks23 or slug shotgun very surprised by how this thing performed I am not a fan of this gun however I completely understand its use case and that's how I used it in the game uh it is way too weak up close in my opinion especially for a shotgun but at distance or even just mid-range the damage actually holds up it actually hits for 100 plus damage at far range but the big downside I found was the accuracy this is one of the strangest weapons to aim with in the game and most of the time it feels lucky to actually land shots up close just because of how off-putting the aim down site are anyways we took 21 kills with eight deaths giving us a 2.6 KD ratio and ranking as the fourth best gun on the list now for the most used weapon on heavy in by far the most referred to as meta for this build we had the Lewis gun this thing is great I definitely understand the backing that it gets high damage decent range plenty of ammo the Lewis gun only falls short in two categories recoil and range the range is self-explanatory but the recoil is abysmal even on controller this thing is like a self-driving Tesla out in some Countryside road trying to find its way back home it has terrible accuracy at range and even up close it's difficult to control but that's the skill Gap I guess we dropped 26 kills for six deaths giving us a 4.3 KD and putting the Lewis gun in a very close second place on our list okay so the M60 is next and I can safely say that this has to be one of the most underrated weapons I've used it definitely gets overlooked because of the Lewis but wow the M60 really beams if you can land some head shot it has a ridiculous headshot multiplier and can melt lights and mediums very quickly the mag size is great The Recoil isn't that bad but the site takes up half the screen so that's a problem anyways there isn't much to say because it doesn't lack at any range or have any crazy flaw to point out the M60 did 24 eliminations with six deaths very similar to our Lewis gun we had a 4.0 KD ratio and that puts it as the third best weapon so far now the sa 1216 very overrated in my opinion I've seen players run this in Diamond ranked and they are almost always free big pots when we come across them I found it very slow to finish kills and the Damage up close always felt just a little too short um I understand that this gun has a rhythm to it and that takes getting used to which I could not achieve in one game alone however I don't see myself returning to learn that Rhythm anytime soon unless it gets the Supreme Almighty Mega damage buff this gun got US 23 eliminations and a shocking 10 deaths leaving us with a 2.3 KD ratio and ranking as the fifth weapon now on to the biggest joke of a gun I've used in the finals the mighty mgl 32 grenade launcher I already know there's going to be some Mega nerd Powers shift player in the comment section trying to defend this game throwing weapon and I'm happy to hear that someone likes it because this thing would make me turn gray if I used it again simply put its like throwing a bouncy ball and waiting for the enemy to pick it up and swallow it the gun doesn't work against any player who has hands and eyes because the grenades have a mind of their own anyways I got a very lucky 13 kills and seven deaths leaving us with a 1.9 KD and easily ranking in at last in seventh place from The Challenge and finally the sledgehammer I will defend this weapon because I do like it and it is very enjoyable to use especially with charge and slam very effective in places with natural cover and near objective points the flaw is very obvious range and exposure which can be avoided most of the time but it is definitely frustrating if you don't have teammates around you or if you get stunned the Sledge managed to pull in 14 kills and six deaths so the KD ratio was 2.3 and unfortunately only ranked as the sixth weapon on the list now looking back at the heavy weapon challenge there are plenty of good options for all game mode if you are looking for the best ranked weapons I would exclusively highlight the Lewis gun as the most viable but the M60 and flamethrower also serve a function depending on your team composition anyways I'd love to hear your thoughts or ideas if you have any I appreciate the comments on these videos as it's great to get a discussion going and I'll do my best to reply if you have any questions ratings are appreciated and don't forget to subscribe if you like this type of content thanks for watching bye-bye now no,"The video discusses heavy weapons in a PVP game mode, ranking them based on KD ratio. The discussed weapons include the flamethrower, the Lewis gun, the M60, and the ks23 or slug shotgun.

The flamethrower is highly effective in close-range fights and chaotic scenarios, causing enemies to panic instead of shooting back. However, its flaw is its limited range, requiring players to close the distance before engaging. Despite this, the flamethrower scored 24 eliminations with only five deaths, giving a 4.8 KD ratio, ranking it at the top.

The video also mentions the Lewis gun and M60 but does not provide specific opinions or details on these weapons.

The ks23 or slug shotgun is another weapon mentioned. The player expresses surprise at the weapon's performance, even though they are not personally a fan of it. They acknowledge its use case but do not provide further details on its effectiveness or performance. 

In terms of overall user opinion, the game appears to be challenging and engaging, with the heavy weapons adding an exciting element to the PVP game mode. However, the video does not provide a comprehensive opinion on the current state of the game. The user has opinions on several in-game weapons:

1) Unnamed Shotgun: The user believes this weapon is too weak, especially for close range combat. It performs well at mid to long range, hitting for 100 plus damage. However, it has a major downside with its accuracy and is difficult to aim with, which can feel frustrating. The user still managed a kill-death (KD) ratio of 2.6 with this weapon, ranking it as the fourth-best gun on their list.

2) Lewis Gun: The user appreciates this weapon for its high damage, decent range, and plentiful ammo. However, they find its recoil and range to be lacking. Despite its recoil being difficult to control, the user achieved a 4.3 KD ratio with it, ranking it as the second-best weapon in their list.

3) M60: The user views this weapon as underrated. It has a strong headshot multiplier and performs well against light and medium enemies. While the recoil is manageable, the site takes up half of the screen, which the user sees as a problem. They achieved a 4.0 KD ratio with this weapon, placing it as the third-best weapon.

4) SA 1216: The user finds this weapon overrated and has seen players use it in Diamond ranked matches.

In terms of the overall state of the game, the user does not provide a direct opinion. However, their detailed analysis of weapon balancing suggests they find it to be a significant The user's opinion on weapon balancing in the game is mixed. They found some weapons to be underpowered and needing a damage buff, such as the unnamed weapon that requires a rhythm to use effectively. This weapon was slow to finish kills, and its close-range damage was considered insufficient. Conversely, they found the MGL 32 Grenade Launcher to be overpowered, comparing its use to throwing a bouncy ball and waiting for the enemy to pick it up and swallow it. The grenades from this weapon were unpredictable, making it difficult for players who aren't highly skilled. 

The user enjoyed using the Sledgehammer weapon due to its effectiveness in areas with natural cover and near objective points. However, they noted its range and exposure as a flaw, which can be frustrating without having teammates around or when getting stunned. 

In terms of the current state of the game, the user seems to appreciate the variety of weapons available for different game modes. They highlighted the Lewis Gun as the most viable weapon, but also mentioned the M60 and Flamethrower as useful depending on the situation. They seem to find the game challenging, as indicated by their use of KD (kill/death) ratios to rank the effectiveness of the weapons. Overall, while they appreciate some aspects of the game, they are critical of certain weapons and their balance.

The Finals Light Class guide,9fy1tWBnhvY,Light Builds and Strategies - The Finals Guides / How to Guides Season 3,light is the highest risk highest reward class in the finals you make one wrong move and it's over so it's important to know how exactly to play to minimize your risk of dying and maximize your reward with my medium guide I focused a lot on Synergy between your chosen specialization weapon and gadgets since as I described in that video medium has very distinct play styles for each specialization therefore making sure your build meshes well to match your specialization optimally is a lot more important than with the light class for light synergizing your build while still relevant isn't as strategy defining as with medum cuz light doesn't have as vast of a difference in play style for specialization although there will still be differences in your approach that I'll get into the goal of the light class is simple you want to deal high damage get high elims and of course survive long enough to do this surviving without a doubt being the most limiting factor of the three and accomplishing our goal so to accomplish our goal forming a strategy to both stay alive and find good opportunities to pick off targets is crucial and that strategy is reflected in every specialization you can choose from and most class exclusive gadgets making the Synergy required for a good build partially already there without much thought with almost everything that's class exclusive to light designed with at least one of these two things in mind your build choices should be defined by which of these two you value more as a player taking what I just said into consideration leaves us with two ways to approach the light class and perhaps a hybrid style there's a play style more focused around creating otherwise non-existent attack opportunities with the downside being a higher risk of death and a play style focused around playing safer meaning less risk of death with the downside being having to wait for attack opportunities to present M themselves rather than forcing them to simplify things we'll call the first play style the aggressive style and the second play style the opportunistic style but let's remember that the end goal is the same regardless of style and one play style does not always fulfill this goal better than the other there is no one size fits-all style or build I've created a list of weapons specializations and gadgets suited to each play style and you'll notice some choices are suited for both because as discussed the light glass of synergy is partially already there to summarize my two lists the aggressive style is focused around creating attack opportunities to play This Way effectively you want a build that's comprised of a high Mobility specialization to minimize the increased risk of death and allowing quick entry into fights plus gadgets that open opportunities for attack such as sonar grenades thermal boar Gateway and everything else I listed I do want to highlight gateways for a second here because these can be used as both an aggressive option and a survivability option making it a perfect choice for those that want to have a bit more safety in their build on top of the high Mobility specialization with this play style you'll be playing at close and mid-ranges often so you'll want a weapon that is also good at close or mid-range this means avoiding weapons like the bow and the sniper because they're more effective from mid to long range they can still work technically but they're not optimal for this style and that goes for everything in the not optimal category the opportunistic style being more about safety and waiting for the perfect moment to strike rather than forcing moments will comprise of a specialization that focuses on keeping you under the radar or at a safe distance and gadgets that are good for escaping or isolating someone during an engagement gadgets such as Vanishing bomb stun gun and tracking Dart are great choices among the class exclusives and of course of course there are others with this play style depending on how you're playing it most weapons can work with the worst choice being the sword only cuz it feels like a crime to not use it with evasive Dash the throwing knives are somewhat usable but the advantages to using evasive Dash with throwing knives greatly outweighs the other specializations which ends up Landing it in my not optimal category now on to describing the actual play Styles in more detail to help you decide which is for you the aggressive play style has the potential of the highest reward but also comes with the most risk this play style is best suited for players that can function well in repeatedly risky and intense situations this means quick thinking to avoid death while also using quick thinking to cause an opponent's death there's a fine balance that needs to be reached here to stop yourself from getting too aggressive that you end up dying or trading a life for a life you'll be using the gadgets at your disposal to help create more opportunities for attacks so you want to avoid going in without first thinking about your next move your opponent's next move and your escape plan if things go wrong or even if they go right you see the tricky part about playing light is that although lights weapons are the highest damaging on average you also have the lowest Health which means you don't want to fight someone head on at the start of of an engagement if it can be avoided and if you're struggling with light this is probably what you're doing wrong catching someone by surprise is what the mobility from your specialization and the opportunities created from your gadgets are for quick thinking is what you need to make yourself slippery enough that you don't end up face to face with an enemy and rather surprise them this play style despite everything negative you may hear about it and the players that play this way is also actually really great for Reviving your team the same slipperiness you'd be using to get away from your opponents can be used to grab your teammates trophies mid fight and get somewhere safe to revive them you'd be surprised at how easy it is to to get away with multiple revives of fight with some quick thinking and simmering down on the aggression the opportunistic play style is a bit more relaxed but still dangerous with the added safety of invisibility distance or both this play style is better suited for more patient players if you're playing this style with the long ranged weapon such as a sniper or bow you'll be most concerned about finding a good position and angle to support your team with damage taking your time to find good shots and possibly an elim or two once you attract too much attention whether you're at a long range or not you'll reposition or use one of your G gadgets such as the stun gun to increase your odds of winning a one-on-one Engagement playing this way at a distance and being uncontested is the ideal scenario but it's unlikely to happen often if playing with a mid or close-ranged weapon you'll be playing slightly differently you'll be observing the fight from a safe place that's somewhat close and waiting for someone to isolate themselves so you can pick them off this can take some time to happen and is what many impatient players will struggle with timing your engagement in this situation can be hard for someone that's used to playing hyper aggressively because in my experience you'll end up waning to use Mobility that you don't have to get in quicker or get out quicker after you're done the gadgets like the stun gun will be used in the same way as with the sniper example to make engagements more favorable for you and gadgets like the vanishing bomb can help with safely getting out when you think you might get cornered ideally if you're isolating someone you'll want to get them before any of their teammates have time to show up and help but if you fail your gadgets and specialization should help you escape there is an element of slipperiness similar to the aggressive play style here but much more discreet while this play style can offer less reward the lower risk of death could mean that it ends up netting you more elims and you otherwise would have Goten with the other play style and people that perfect this style will be just as big of a threat as even the best aggressive players you may have noticed that the grapple hook was a specialization choice for both play Styles it's not an ultra aggressive specialization like evasive Dash and it doesn't necessarily have to be used as an opportunistic specialization like the cloaking device but it can work in both play Styles which means it can also be used as a bridge that allows you to switch between the two play Styles freely simply by making slight changes in your gadgets the weapons that are best suited for this hybrid style are mid-ranged weapons like the SMGs or pistols so it's easier to switch Styles but in reality any weapon you like will do despite everything that I've gone over in this guide lights gadgets as a whole are so great that you can pretty much put any three together with any specialization and it'll work which is why at the start I said your build isn't as strategy defining as it is with medium the most important thing about light is that you're accomplishing the goal I left on screen and what that requires more than a good build is above average aim and a good method for avoiding damage both of which can only really be improved with practice and learning from your mistakes the better your aim the less you have to worry about avoiding damage the better you are at avoiding damage the less you have to worry about aim but get great at both and you'll see just how strong light can be thanks for watching,"The player expresses that the light class in the game is a high-risk, high-reward class. It requires careful strategic planning and precise execution to avoid dying while also maximizing rewards. The player notes the difference between light and medium classes, indicating that the former has less variability in play style compared to the latter. 

The player also discusses the importance of synergy between the chosen specialization, weapon, and gadgets. However, they note that for the light class, this synergy isn't as defining to the strategy as it is for the medium class. 

The goal of the light class is to deal high damage, get high eliminations, and survive. Survival is considered the most limiting factor. The player suggests two approaches to the light class: one that creates attack opportunities at the risk of higher death, and another that plays it safe, waiting for attack opportunities to arise, resulting in less risk of death. 

Based on the details given, it can be inferred that the player finds the game to be strategically complex and requiring thoughtful planning, particularly when playing as the light class. The player does not express any explicit negative criticism about the game's current state, implying that they may be satisfied with the game's level of challenge and strategic depth.

The Finals Light Class guide,QtZNoE_naGg,ULTIMATE Beginner&#39;s Guide to Light Class The Finals From a Top 200 Player In 2023,"hello everyone my name is Chris in this video we will go over the easiest yet most effective way to dominate your rank tournaments as the light class in the finals I will talk about the most optimal team composition for playing light best weapons gadgets and abilities to use how to position yourself how to properly time your engage how to properly rotate with a team correct way to fight for an objective for a desired position how to defend the cash out how to steal the cash out and then we will go for some useful tips and tricks here and there to help you win more duels and stay useful throughout the match if this video is going to get 1,000 likes I'm going to start working on beginner tips for the finals there will be at least 50 of them let's get started before we begin with the guide I'd like to warn you that the current season 1 State light class has to be the most pathetic and miserable State the light class has ever been due to a massive utility and weapon nerve this role has an incredibly High skill floor and skill ceiling to the point where you have to be an extraordinary player from the start to have mediocre results that you would have gotten with zero experience on medium as well as you have to suffer and spend a few hundreds of hours constantly dying losing games that you should have won losing teammates because they lost faith in you tilting burning out saying to yourself that you would never ever play the freaking light role again just to play the light role 2 days later and continue the Vicious Cycle right now the game revolves around High sustain medium medium heavy composition where you are quite literally holding hands together supporting each other and keeping everyone alive and healthy with defibs Shield bubble and healing beams you always have an artificial cover to hide behind you and if you've made a positional mistake or see simply lost your 1 V one duel your team can always back you up with a shield plus instant defib res combination followed by a quick healing beam to get you back on track for 99% of you guys watching this video the medium medium heavy composition is going to be the most optimal and it's exceptionally easy to use meaning that you will be able to play more games you will have more fun you will lose less and it's not as reliant on the perfect execution and correct engage timing as the light medium heavy composition that we will talk right now a light medium heavy setup has to be the only way to make the light roll work as of right now because you need both strong point presence as well as the ability to keep your teammates alive and healthy you can still make any composition work in Publix as people will never punish you for the major mistakes you are making and that's exactly the reason you never understand that something is fundamentally wrong you understand it only when you get absolutely devoured by the people that are playing correct compositions that are absolutely countering your composition I also need to add that this game is very heavily team playay oriented and you absolutely need to find good players in a competitive Discord so three of you can discuss strategies in real time 3 to one your engages and use the windows of opportunities that are created either by your team proper ability usage and effective damage tradeoffs or major positional or mechanical Mistakes by opponents I'm going to leave a link to competitive Discord where you can verify yourself prove that you are a gamer and find good teammates when we talk about best performing weapons for the light class it's important to fundamentally understand why some of them are completely terrible and unplayable so you are very squishy and you want to deal high amounts of burst damage while keeping the distance between you and the enemies because I don't think there is any light in this game that would want to brawl a heavy with a shotgun RPG or an explosive barrel with two C4s attached there are also gas mines explosive mines gas grenades frag grenades that are casually ending up at my feet every single time I personally play light I'm pretty sure that's happening to you as well so it already takes every single melee weapon out of equation due to the nature of the game top it off with an easy to track character model and very limited amounts of movement while you are scoped and dueling and you have a perfect candidate for the next7 James Bond movie you also want your weapon to be consistent and easy to use at the same time and realistically speaking we are left with two options it's either going to be a shotgun or an MP5 I personally think that shotgun is better due to the fact that it's so much easier to use it you can quite literally double tap any character in the game press your invisibility reload and repeat the process until you die from another random something that has never meant to hit you but hit you anyway L MP5 is better on paper for the majority of the player based this weapon is way too difficult to use especially when everything is blowing up and you have 90 FPS your mouse pad is dirty you haven't been training your aim in ages pick the shotgun when we talk about best abilities for the light class I feel like invisibility has to be the winner by far because both grapple and dash are providing you with some movement but at the end of the day you want to be unexpected you want to be a scout and a Silent Assassin I can't imagine a situation where I am grappling onto three players and not dying within a millisecond after I'm in their line of sight I can't imagine the situation where a talented light player with Enis will not be able to track me down after I used three of my dashes to escape him it's very very difficult to compete with invisibility for what it does to you majority of light players never get any major value in team fights and usually go alone and die in the middle of three teams just to coin back 25 seconds later and repeat the process again and it usually happens when they don't have invisibility they can't set up but we'll talk about it in later chapters of this guide light BL gges are very interesting you can't enable your team with movement or heals like a medium class would do you can't protect and tank damage Dage like a heavy would do but you still need to be useful in a fight and you do that by picking up a glitch grenade a stun gun a frag grenade or a gas grenade depending on how you feel about them frag grenade is better because there is no Friendly Fire enemies can't see the warning sign and they will never be able to Shield against it and just going to blow up from cringe as a result let's quickly talk about how to use glitch and frag best way to do it is to throw one and then throw another after it you do it by canceling your animation because it feels like there is just so much downtime on your glitch plus glitch combination it just takes inh human amount of time to pull the second glitch grenade out for some reason if you playing from above you can always right click grenades if let's say they are stealing the cash out or just fighting below you your glitch grenade will apply silence effect and Destroy Bubbles and shields but you need to throw the glitch grenade at the heavy player that plays the bubble because glitching the bubble without glitching the heavy will not do anything as a result stung gun got heavily nerfed and I highly advise you to choose medium or light characters as your potential victims because every single time I stun the heavy dude just turns around 180 and two Taps me with a shotgun after I living with one HP after my two tap with my shotgun because his is obviously so much bigger than mine I guess that's just a skill issue you can scope your stun gun for a moment to get a better accuracy on a Target that's relatively far from you and in later chapters I'm going to explain when how and where you should use your utility items to get the full potential positioning and timings in the finals are far more important than flashy aim it doesn't matter how good of an aimer you are when you are going in one versus 10 and dying it doesn't matter how good your tracking was if you are shooting the guy with a shield or he's constantly getting Mercy pocketed by the medium if you are at the wrong place at the wrong time you're going to die or even worse remain useless if you are approaching early everyone will turn around and shoot your 150 HP small fragile light bu if you are approaching late your team is already at a severe disadvantage because they have to spend offensive cooldowns trying to protect themselves because there is not enough sustain with single medium and they are forced to play in a bad position because of you and even if you somehow win the fight because enemy players played bad don't forget that there are third parties don't forget that there are fourth parties and yeah that's going to be rough man ideally you want to use your heavy player as a shark bait he's going to be the one that has to start the fight or at least make them think that he is starting the fight maybe he shoots in their Direction maybe he puts up a bubble maybe he uses a taunt and he's like look at me I am here it's infinitely easier to clitch stun and frag people when they are semi-stationary scoping zoned in on your heavy player while you are setting up behind them and preparing your sneaky beaky assassination the major problem with most light players I see is that they think they can get away with dying especially dying alone in the middle of three teams fighting while you are protecting cash out on the other side of the map how many times you saw your light player running to the other cash out on the other side of the map dies there and now you are getting completely cooked two versus three and there are always six more pepega players on the enemy teams that that would gladly sacrifice their life and qualification spot just to party poop and grief your cash out and your guy is coining 30 seconds later he's late to the fight he's late everywhere and you are losing because of him don't be that guy when we talk about the Scout role you still want to play close to your medium and heavy so you can receive healing and protection while helping your team with finishing off low HP targets because at the end of the day even if they run AK plus Louis gun you still need to do some damage in order to help them to soften up squishies and make them finish them off it's also a lot easier to time your engages and be efficient because if you die 50 m away both of your medium and heavy are going to be forced to waste their cooldowns defensively just to have a net negative situation as a result you guys now are out of position you don't have any offensive cooldowns and most importantly you don't have any time to steal or defend the cash out tragedy to say the least when it comes to your glitch and Frack usage you want to set them up as your team goes in because if you don't finish your targets they tend to get healed or Escape imagine the situation where you are approaching a medium medium heavy composition in a close quarter environment one glitch and a frag will drastically change the amount of time and resources that you and your team would have to spend fighting them they will not be able to use the shield bubble or an RPG they will not be able to heal each other they will not be able to use the jump pad or a zip line to escape and now imagine that you glitched and Ned all of them but approach 7 seconds later everyone is full HP heavy is looking at you behind with a bubble with an RPG and his hand and smiling because he knows that you've wasted your perfect window of opportunity and you are an idiot you know that he knows that you've wasted your perfect window of opportunity and you are an idiot and if I were to be you I would be a little bit sad in that situation and of course don't forget about third parties and fourth parties the longer it takes for you to kill the first team more time second and third team will have to completely cook you on the point after because you're going to be exhausted out of cooldowns out of position yeah very very bad sometimes you just have the option to glitch and frag due to the map layout or other factors such as High Ground Advantage when they are above you or your team inability to catch up and start the fight in time while you see a prey a slow gazelle that you can actually eat alive while no one is looking at you it's very important to be patient gather information and try to pick off a medium or a light player that's out of position with a quick invis stun double shotgun in this combination perhaps you would also want to cancel the resurrect with the glitch grenade if you are smart about it so what do you do after that you just play safe in a three versus two situation your team has massive advantage and you just have fun playing against the medium or distracting the heavy while your team is tearing them apart see you in the next one take care","The user, Chris, expresses a strong dissatisfaction with the current state of the light class in the game, describing it as ""pathetic and miserable."" This is due to a significant utility and weapon nerf that has occurred. According to him, the light class now requires an exceptionally high level of skill to achieve even mediocre results. He mentions the need for hundreds of hours of practice and a lot of frustration, including losing games and teammates, which can lead to player burnout. 

Furthermore, Chris asserts that the game now favors a high sustain medium-medium-heavy composition. This involves players supporting each other and keeping each other alive with defibrillators, shield bubbles, and healing beams. If a player makes a mistake or loses a duel, the team can support them with a shield and an instant defibrillator resuscitation combination. 

Therefore, Chris's opinion of the current state of the game is negative, particularly regarding the balance of weapons and the effectiveness of the light class role. He finds the light class to be underpowered and less enjoyable to play due to recent changes. The user seems to be favoring the medium medium heavy composition for gameplay, stating that it is optimal and easy to use, leading to more enjoyable and successful gaming experiences. There is also mention of a light medium heavy composition, although this is described as more reliant on perfect execution and timing. 

The user mentions that the game is heavily oriented towards team play and strategies, and suggests that players need to find good teammates, communicate effectively, and utilize opportunities that arise from proper ability usage and positional or mechanical mistakes by opponents.

Regarding weapon balancing, the user discusses the best performing weapons for the light class, stating that some are unplayable due to their lack of burst damage and squishiness. The user suggests that the light class should focus on dealing high amounts of burst damage while maintaining distance from enemies and avoiding brawling with heavy classes. 

Overall, the user seems to enjoy the game, but suggests that there are certain strategies and compositions that are more effective than others, and that understanding of the game and weapon balancing is important to success. The opinion about weapon balancing is that there is a need for improvements. The player finds that the prevalence of gas and frag grenades makes melee weapons less effective, as these grenades always seem to end up near them during gameplay. This player also expresses a preference for the shotgun over the MP5, stating that the shotgun is easier to use and more consistent, especially in high-action scenarios. They find the MP5 too difficult to use, especially when the game gets chaotic.

In terms of overall user opinion on the current state of the game, the player finds the game to be challenging. They express dissatisfaction with the character model's limited movement while scoped and dueling, stating it makes the character an easy target. The player also feels that the invisibility ability is the best for the light class, as it allows for stealth and unpredictability, which they value over movement abilities like grapple and dash. They also note that the light class characters don't often contribute significantly in team fights and often die quickly, only to respawn and repeat the process. The individual's opinion seems to center around weapon balancing and character classes in the game:

1. Weapon Balancing: They find that the frag grenade is superior because it does not inflict Friendly Fire and enemies cannot see the warning sign or shield against it. They also highlighted the strategy of using the glitch grenade and frag grenade in combination, suggesting that the glitch grenade has a long downtime when combined. This person seems to prefer the frag and glitch grenades over other weapons due to their effects and potential strategies. They also mention the stun gun, which they believe has been heavily nerfed, making it less effective against heavy characters.

2. Character Classes: The user seems to prefer medium or light characters for their potential victims, suggesting that heavy characters are more difficult to defeat, especially when using the stun gun. They mention an issue where heavy characters can quickly turn around and defeat them, indicating a balance issue between different character classes.

3. Overall Game State: The user appears to be engaged and invested in the game, examining the details of different weapons, strategies, and character classes. However, they seem to have some frustrations, particularly regarding the balance between different weapons and character classes. They also express a desire for better utility from certain items and more consistent performance from various weapons. Weapon Balancing Opinions:
- The user believes that strategy and timing are more important than the precise aim or the power of the weapon. 
- They express frustration over situations where they feel they're powerless against enemies with shields or those receiving constant healing, indicating that they may believe some defensive abilities or healing weapons are overpowered.
- The user suggests that lighter, more fragile characters should approach conflicts strategically rather than head-on, implying that they feel these characters are at a disadvantage in direct combat.

Overall User Opinions:
- The user seems dissatisfied with the current state of the game, expressing frustration over various aspects of gameplay.
- They criticize players who think they can get away with dying, especially those who die alone in the midst of multiple teams fighting, suggesting they believe the current game mechanics may encourage reckless behavior.
- The user mentions the problem with third and fourth parties interfering in fights, indicating they may perceive a lack of balance in team-based combat.
- They seem to feel that the game rewards team play and strategic positioning rather than individual skill. 
- They also mention the annoyance of players who disrupt the game, implying that they may believe the game lacks effective mechanisms to prevent such behavior.
- The user seems to prefer strategic and team-oriented gameplay, using the heavy player to distract enemies while the lighter player sneaks up from behind. This suggests they might not be satisfied with the current game dynamics that perhaps don't support such strategies effectively. The player expresses frustration over the timing issues in the game, especially in relation to the Scout role. The player believes that the Scout should be playing close to the medium and heavy characters to ensure healing and protection while also assisting in offensive activities. The player thinks that it's key for the Scout to inflict some damage, even when using weapons like the AK and Louis gun, to help in softening up the enemy.

The player emphasizes the importance of timing engagements efficiently as dying 50 meters away could force the medium and heavy characters to waste their defensive cooldowns, leading to a disadvantageous situation. This can result in the team being out of position, lacking offensive cooldowns, and having insufficient time to steal or defend the cash out. 

The player also provides a critique of the use of the Glitch and Frack. The player suggests using them strategically as the team advances, as failure to eliminate targets can lead them to heal or escape. The player describes a scenario where poor timing can lead to wasting a perfect window of opportunity, and emphasizes the importance of timing in using the Glitch and Frack effectively.

Furthermore, the player stresses the need to be mindful of potential third and fourth parties. The user seems to imply that the game requires strategic thinking, cooperation, and efficient use of resources and abilities. Based on the critique, the user seems to believe that there are certain mechanics and strategies in the game that could be improved, especially with regards to timing and the coordination of roles and abilities. The user's opinion about weapon balancing seems to be mixed. They express frustration about how exhausting it can be to go up against multiple teams, potentially implying that the weapons may not be balanced enough to handle these situations effectively. However, they also mention having the option to leverage certain tactics like using the map layout, High Ground Advantage, and quick invis stun double shotgun, which could suggest that they appreciate the strategic depth that the current weapon system provides.

The user also points out that it's important to be patient and gather information, hinting at a strategic aspect of gameplay they seem to enjoy. They recommend picking off a medium or light player that's out of position, suggesting that they find the game rewarding when they can exploit enemy mistakes.

When they discuss utilizing the glitch grenade to cancel the resurrect, the user seems to be highlighting an aspect of the game mechanics they find enjoyable and smart.

Finally, the user's comment about having fun playing in a three versus two situation where their team has a massive advantage, implies that they enjoy the game most when they have a distinct upper hand.

Overall, the user seems to have a generally positive opinion of the game, but they may have some issues with certain aspects of the game balance. They advise being strategic, exploiting enemy mistakes, and using the game's mechanics to their advantage."
The Finals Light Class guide,NiA-AWMCrzU,The ULTIMATE guide for the LIGHT CLASS in The Finals!,so the light class is undoubtedly one of the most enjoyable classes to play in the finals but I would argue it is also one of the hardest due to how little Health you have compared to everyone else and because of that it can definitely be very difficult to get the hang of So today we're going through a relatively fundamental guide on how to play the light class now I will be doing this for both the medium and heavy classes in the next couple of videos too so if you are new around here be sure to subscribe for more finals content but with that being said let's get stuck right into it now before we get into the nitty-gritty of like your load out and stuff like that just your general overall play style you should be considering yourself as essentially a disruptor or infiltrator I do see a lot of people picking the light class and then they kind of just go in guns blazing thinking they're the hero or the main character and in reality that is not a very effective way to play this game unless you are an absolute freak at which point I'd imagine you're probably not watching this video you don't want to go head-to-head and pretty much expect to win gunfights every other class in the game obviously has more health than you and obviously when you're coming up against the light class even though that is a fair fight in terms of HP that doesn't guarantee that you're going to win that gunfight either so you pretty much want to avoid going head-to-head into gunfights unless the odds are just absolutely stacked in your favor if you see a heavy on like 30 Health then obviously that's a little bit different but if you see you're heavy on full health you don't want to be running in head-to-head cuz you will absolutely lose those gunfights now when I say about being a disruptor what I mean is mostly just talking about causing openings for your teammates as an example you might cloak and then sneak into an area where the enemy team is you're obviously going to get in there without them knowing you can then sort of pop out and deal a bit of damage and at that point the enemy team is going to be distracted they might have all been looking in the direction of where your teammates are ready to stop them from barging in but now all of a sudden they're distracted they're kind of thinking oh someone's in here and you've just distracted the entire enemy team and even if they all focus on you and kill you they're still focusing on probably the wrong thing because CU then your teammates can sort of charge in and what do you know there are enemies who are looking in the wrong direction now or if they don't manage to kill you for example kind of adding on to what you've already done if you get in there deal a bit of damage even potentially get a kill and the enemies are focusing on you you can then dip and essentially just run away at which point a lot of enemies are going to be distracted by that and actually sort of Chase you at which point they are then leaving the objective and once again your teammates who were waiting there ready for you to do that you've maybe gotten one kill drawn the other enemy out who's chasing you and they're probably going to kill you but that leaves one enemy protecting the objective your two teammates can go in that's now 2V1 they're going to win that and even if you know the other enemy kills you it's still a 2V1 in your favor they can then revive you so that is essentially what I mean by being a disruptor and that is realistically how you want to be playing as the light class you want to be very in and out you want to get in and do your job whether that be to distract get a quick kill or even steal an objective and then essentially just immediately try and Escape like I said it not only can save you if you do try and Escape but it can often also draw enemies away which is very very helpful for your teammates now getting into the load out side of things starting off with the specializations in my opinion the cloak is by far the best or at least the easiest to pick up and therefore kind of like the easiest one to use it doesn't necessarily mean it is the absolute best but I think just for the general player base the cloak is probably the overall best specialization for the light class this one really allows you to navigate the map a little bit easier it really allows you to sneak right up to your enemies and you can kind of just keep enemies distracted the examples I just gave about you know getting into an area and distracting enemies even in that same situation if you're dealing a bit of damage and you've drawn all the focus towards you but then they're not shooting you you can once again equip that cloak and all of a sudden you have vanished in thin air at which point those enemies are now essentially themselves thinking oh my God I have to try and kill this guy or else he's going to you know get behind me and kill me so once again that only distracts them further and instead of you know focusing on defending the objective they're just now worried about the little light class that is running around their ankles you could literally just be sitting in the corner doing absolutely nothing but they you know they may not know where you are depending on the lighting in the room and stuff like that it's going to cause panic and it's going to completely distract those enemies and that is why I personally think the cloak is the best now with that being said the evasive Dash and the grapple are both very very solid too and if you're really good with your movement then these are equally as good as the cloak in my opinion like I said I just think the cloak has essentially the lowest skill Gap meaning it is the easiest to pick up the dash and the grapple both have a slightly higher skill ceiling meaning I think if you're really really really good with the evasive Dash it is probably better than the cloak but you do have to be very good to be able to do that and therefore like I said the cloak is just the easiest one to pick up and therefore probably the best one for just the general population of this game now in terms of the weapon side of things and once again as goes with all of this stuff it is essentially subjective there's not really any objective bests in the game My person personal favorite is actually the XP 54 but that is definitely just personal preference I wouldn't actually say it's the best by any means it's probably the Jack of all trades in that it is the best allaround weapon but I think there are definitely better weapons it is just my personal favorite it is very easy to use and it just feels very comfortable for me personally with that being said the M11 especially after its recent buff feels very very solid as well especially up close the v95 pistol is also very good too both of those deal very solid damage good rate of fire and both of them essentially just send a lot of damage down range now even though I just said that there is no objective best in the game or anything currently the sh1 1900 is let's just face it busted and can quite literally two tap a heavy so that thing is absolutely clapped and if you combine that shotgun with the cloak it is genuinely broken at this point you can cloak walk right up to a heavy and shoot them in the ass and you will kill them in two shots that is absolutely clapped so if you're really struggling with the light class that is a really good way to play this game game even though it is very annoying just getting right next to your enemies with that cloak and then essentially two tapping them with the shotgun now moving on to the gadget side of things I would say personally at least for me anyway the most balanced setup to help win games is pretty much any kind of grenade so for example the frag the gas or the Pyro grenades just for that added area of effect damage it's really helpful for if someone's trying to steal the objective and you're you know you just not in a position to run up there and kill them throwing a grenade is obviously very handy I'd then say the stun gun is probably the best in terms of just helping you deal with Heavies or realistically just escaping tight situations it is a little bit more Niche and you know you have to be very accurate with it and stuff like that but it does get you out of a lot of tight situations and then one that I think not many people are actually using and to be honest only started using this very recently this one is the glitch grenade and in my opinion this may be the single best gadget for the light class what this will do is essentially cancel stuff like specializations and gadgets so if the enemy team is you know sitting in tight on the objective they're relying on turrets maybe the heavy mesh shield and then some mines to defend that objective if you can throw a glitch grenade in there and you know affect all of them you could pretty much take all of those things out that I just mentioned the shields the mines the turrets and obviously that is going to be a massive help to you and your teammates especially when it comes to the mesh Shields those are obviously absolutely brutal if there is a really good heavy on the other team using a mes Shield it often feels like there is essentially nothing you can do so the glitch grenades are very underrated in my opinion and I may actually do a video just solely on those in the near future outside of that setup that I just mentioned though I will also say the vanishing bomb is also super useful if you don't have the cloak on as it essentially does the same thing as the cloak and to be honest you can double this up with the cloak and just have more time you know under the cloak but I personally think that is a bit of a waste of a slot so the vanishing bomb is good but I would probably only use that if you are using the evasive Dash or the grapple now to pretty much summarize the light class like I said you need to remember remember your role in the team and especially remember that you are pretty much a glass Cannon I see a lot of people picking the light class and because of the movement speed and it it kind of feels like you're playing Call of Duty you've got quick movement and all that kind of thing a lot of people play that as if they are the main character and they're just running around trying to get you know one-on-one gunfights and realistically that is just not the way to play the light class if you're playing against you know enemies that are genuine Bots then sure you can do that but for the most part that is not how you want to be playing the light class now that doesn't mean you can't dominate in terms of kills because you absolutely can some of my highest kill games with the light class but to be effective in terms of winning games your role in the team like I said is to distract enemies to draw them away essentially just being a little Menace and causing them to pretty much just get flustered at which point they are just not nearly as effective if the enemies are set up on the objective and they all know what they're doing that can be nearly impossible to break down but if they get distracted and they start freaking out cuz there's a light class running around their ankles that turns those players from from a very solid Squad into three enemies who are essentially useless all at the same time and obviously that means your teammates are going to have a much easier time on the objectives and obviously cleaning up those enemies the last thing to remember is to make the most of your movement as well obviously you do have far less Health than the other classes but your movement is so much better than the other classes so don't be stagnant and slow you don't want to play the light class like you would play the heavy class you need to absolutely milk the fact that you are faster and lighter than everyone else and that combined with playing your role you can definitely be very effective as the light class in the finals I key to hear your thoughts though so let me know of anything in this video that maybe you guys disagree with or any tips of your own for those of reading in the comments section I'm always Keen to hear your thoughts but with that being said thank you all very much for watching you guys have a great day and I'll see you all out there in the arena,"The player enjoys the light class in the finals but finds it challenging due to the relatively low health compared to other classes. They advise new players to approach the light class as a disruptor or infiltrator rather than attempting to confront enemies head-on due to the disadvantage in health points. They argue against going into gunfights unless the odds are heavily in their favor. They suggest using tactics such as cloaking and creating openings for teammates. However, they don't provide direct comments on weapon balancing. The overall opinion on the game's current state seems to be positive, acknowledging its complexity and the strategic approach required for different classes. The user's opinion about the game seems to be quite positive. They view the game as tactical and strategic where distraction and diversion play a crucial role. They view the 'light' class as an effective disruptor, capable of creating opportunities for teammates by distracting enemies and drawing them away from objectives. They mention that the ability to 'pop out', deal a bit of damage, and then escape is essential for this class, and note that this strategy can often result in enemies leaving their post to chase the player, which is beneficial for the team. The user also emphasizes on the importance of teamwork, and how effectively using the abilities of the light class could turn the tide of the game in their favor.

However, the user doesn't provide specific comments on weapon balancing. They mention a 'cloak' in the context of 'specializations', but without further details, it's unclear whether this is a weapon or an ability, and what their opinion on it is. The user believes that the cloak is the best specialization for the light class in the game, making it easier for players to navigate the map and distract enemies. The user appreciates that the cloak allows players to vanish and cause panic among enemies, which can distract them from defending their objective. However, the user also recognizes the benefits of the evasive dash and the grapple, stating that they are equally good as the cloak if a player has honed their movement skills. The user thinks that the cloak is more accessible, with a lower skill gap for beginners, but that the evasive dash could potentially be more powerful if used skillfully. Overall, it seems that the user is satisfied with the current state of the game, particularly appreciating the balance and variety of weapons available. The user's opinion about weapon balancing in the game seems to be subjective. They believe there is no definitive 'best' weapon, as it depends on the player's preference. They mention their personal favorite is the XP 54, citing that it's easy to use and feels comfortable. However, they also state that they believe other weapons might be more effective. The M11, especially after a recent buff, and the v95 pistol are highlighted as solid options due to their good rate of fire and damage.

The user points out an imbalance with the sh1 1900, calling it 'busted' and 'broken' in combination with the cloak ability, as it can kill a heavy class character in just two shots. This seems to be a source of frustration.

Regarding the overall state of the game, the user suggests that it is playable but implies that there are some frustrating elements, such as the combination of the cloak and sh1 1900. For gadgets, they recommend any type of grenade (frag, gas, or Pyro) as the most balanced setup to help win games, with these being particularly useful for dealing area of effect damage. The user's opinion on weapon balancing in the game is generally positive. The user appreciates the utility of the grenade, giving examples of how it can be useful in dealing with heavy enemies. They also commend the stun gun for its potential in escaping tight situations, though they note that it requires precision and accuracy. 

The user also praises the glitch grenade, describing it as the best gadget for the light class. They explain how it can cancel out enemy specializations and gadgets such as shields, mines, and turrets, thereby being a huge help to the team. They do, however, mention that the glitch grenade is underrated and not used by many players. 

The user also finds the vanishing bomb useful, especially in combination with the cloak, although they express that using both together could be seen as a waste of a slot. 

Overall, the user appears to appreciate the current state of the game, with a particular emphasis on the strategic use of the different weapons and gadgets. They also highlight the importance of remembering one's role in the team, suggesting a strong focus on team-based gameplay. The user's opinions on weapon balancing appear to center around the light class, which they believe is currently overpowered. They note that many people are choosing this class due to its quick movement speed, drawing comparisons to the fast-paced gameplay of Call of Duty. This speed allows players to engage in one-on-one gunfights frequently, which they note is not necessarily the most strategic way to play but can still be effective against less-skilled opponents. 

However, they also note that despite its lower health compared to other classes, the light class can still dominate in terms of kills. This is because the class's role is to distract enemies and cause chaos, thereby making it easier for their teammates to achieve objectives. They emphasize the importance of making full use of the class's movement abilities and not playing it like the slower, heavier classes.

Overall, the user seems to enjoy the game but suggests that the light class might be too strong and could potentially disrupt the balance of the gameplay. They recommend that players fully utilize the class's unique abilities to be most effective.

The Finals Light Class guide,fiB8Ss0L4tU,The BEST Loadout for EVERY BUILD in The Finals 2024,after playing the finals almost every day since his release and trying out everything the game has to offer I believe I have found the best loadouts for every build in the final of course this isn't set in stone as everybody plays a little bit different these will be some important pointers to help build your own contestants that suit your play style drop a like And subscribe if you enjoy the video and without wasting any time heading straight into the light build for specializations the best pick has to be the cloaking device you go invisible and in the finals it's actually very hard to see cloaked players then if you take a look at all the weapons the light class has to offer they're almost all back best used in close range battles having the cloaking device as your specialization allows you to get up really close up to the enemies without them seeing you and getting close with these weapons helps you put out a lot more damage I also love the cloaking device for scouting enemies for your team as before pushing a team you want to know where they are positioned so you can put yourself in the best spot possible the cloaking device allows you to investigate your enemies without them seeing you and then if you are a team player you can relay this information to your teammate then the other specialization I would recommend is the evasive Dash now for 95% of the player base I would say just stick with the cloaking device but if you have exceptional movement and solid aim to back it up then the evasive Dash might be a good pick for you but the key is you have to have some high level movement otherwise your 150 Health points will get drained very quickly the idea is that you want to be dashing back and forth so enemies blow through all their ammo trying to shoot you then you can easily take them out when they're stuck reloading the other benefit to the evasive Dash similar to the cloaking device is that allows you to get up close to your enemy to deal burst damage you can quickly Dash right up to your enemy with a shotgun a melee weapon or an SMG and quickly eliminate them before they realize what happened but this is where good aim is essential if you miss these important shots after dashing into an enemy it will most likely turn you into a trophy especially with heavy players being as strong as they are one well-placed RPG rocket can take you out if you aren't being careful now the grappling hook does have some utility and having the ability to quickly Dash by using the grapple hop trick is nice but it just isn't as beneficial as the other specializations and honestly at this point if you're choosing the grappling hook just switch to medium and use a jump pad you will have 100 more health Health points and you can use literal wall hacks on top of it then for your weapon the go-to for most players in high ranks is the XP 54 it is a super easy to use SMG as The Recoil pattern is straight up to the right and it has a scope on it making it much easier to land your shot now the other SMG option that you could use is the M11 in theory this weapon is very good as it can deal a lot of damage fast and it has 10 more bullets in a clip than the xp54 and its reload speed is much faster but it is simply way harder to use first off it has less range she have to get up really close to your enemy then the iron sights and the shake makes it really hard to see where you're shooting at and The Recoil pattern Zips back and forth making it difficult to control so if you do want to use an SMG just stick with the xp54 then the other weapon I would recommend for the Le class is the sh1 1900 the double barrel shotgun you can twap any player in the game including heavy and in combination with a cloaking device or evasive Dash you can get up right next to your enemies and basically insta kill them the one thing you do have to keep in mind is that as soon as you shoot your two shots you need to get out of there as soon as possible possible and change position if you stick around just a little bit too long you will be an easy elimination now the other weapons are certainly fun to use but they have no meaningful place in a competitive setting right now for the gadgets one that I highly suggest using is the glitch grenade one of the most OP things in the game right now are Shields and heals one glitch grenade is able to completely deny the other team's abilities making them sitting ducks for your teammates to capitalize on I also recommend using the stun gun as it makes whoever you stun an easy target as they can barely move can't interact with anything can't use abilities in the can even aim down sight now for the last Gadget I would either suggest running a breach charge you can destroy walls and create new openings to use gas grenades to block off an area of the map and make it difficult for the enemies to steal the cashio or I would use the pyrro grenade as it takes away gas and the gas grenades are a huge counter to the light build to being able to take it away with a power grenades is a huge plus now onto the medium build for specializations the best pick hands down is the healing gun it allows you to keep your team alive and in combination with the shields from the heavy class it is very hard for enemies to eliminate you it also Al cancels out gas damage so if you are healing your teammates they can still steal a cash out that is covered in gas now the other best specialization is Recon sensus it is literally wall hack and as long as there isn't fog you can see the enemies across the entire map Recon sensus allows you to get a lot of free and easy eliminations as you can always pre- aim wherever the enemies are going to be and if you communicate with your team Recon sensus is incredibly strong as you can see where each team is going so you know exactly which cash out to steal or which Vault you should be going to then whenever a team respawns you can quickly activate Recon senses to see which direction they are so your team can set up accordingly for weapons there's only really two options I would focus on the akm and the F car if you look at the F car it has an easy recoil pattern to master and good optic to see where you're shooting it also deals a ton of damage but of course it has a very small magazine you only have 20 bullets before you have to reload so if you are confident in your aim and can hit consistent head shot the F car is really good otherwise I would suggest the akm the akm has a MAG size of 30 36 almost double that of the F car The Recoil and the iron sights are certainly harder to use than the F car with a few minutes in the practice range you shouldn't have any real trouble with it now one of the big benefits of running the akm over the F car is the damage you can do to Shields you can quickly dump one mag into a heavy player's mes shield and completely destroy it then as you're reloading your team can deal the followup damage for you or if you have two akms on your team there's a ton of Firepower the enemies have to walk into so both assault rifles are great you should try them both out to see which works better for your play style for gadgets there is a clear meta always be using the defibrillator having the capability to revive a teammate in the heat of a battle is so incredibly strong and if you aren't already using it you need to start using it now now do keep in mind the defib provides enemies with around half of their Total Health I believe it is 40% so if you have a heal beam you should be using it on them right away the other Gadget I would use 100% of the time is the jump pad allows you to quickly get up to High Ground when necessary then if you put it on an angle you can quickly bounce towards or away from enemies also you can't forget that heavy players don't have much Mobility at all so you need to be using the jump pad had to help enable them to get around the map you can also place a jump pad right under cash out to make it bounce and enemies will have a very hard time stealing it there are just so many uses for the jump pad so I recommend always having it in your load out then for the last Gadget you have a few different options depending on your play style an easy pick is the explosive mind you can place some on the cash out in doorways or on the enemy trophies to deny the revive then there is also the aps turet that can help you defend an objective by destroying any incoming projectiles there's also the zip line that allows you to gather around the map quickly then the gadget that I run most often is the gas grenade allows me to force enemies out of a position and you have more control over the gas grenades than you do with the gas mine the gas also goes through walls and Floors making it very hard for enemies to see it coming and it gives you hit markers whenever you're dealing damage to an enemy which helps give you a rough idea of where they're plan then we have the heavy build for the specialization most of the time you should be using the mes Shield blocks incoming damage if with medium players behind you the enemies will have a lot of difficulty trying to take you out the goo gun and the charging slam both have their moments but the mes Shield is almost always a better pick for the weapons you have two options that are very powerful firstly there is the sa 1216 an automatic shotgun that I believe has the highest damage per second of any weapon in the game Heavy with an auto shoty in close-range fights is almost impossible to out gun then when you also have a medium player healing him at the same time he is even stronger when you use the shotgun with the mes Shield allows you to deny damage from range but then when they get up close they get deleted by the high DPS the other great pick is the ls gun it has consistent damage with an easy to control recoil pattern then it also has a MAG size of 40 s you can keep shooting for quite a while you can never go wrong defaulting to the ls gun when you aren't sure what you should be using the first Gadget I always recommend using as a heavy player is the RPG it's a good way to get some quick damage on your enemies and it is the perfect counter to any light players running around the next Gadget I always use is the C4 that's because it allows you to do the most overpowered trick in the game by attaching the C4s to explosives then throwing and exploding them in enemy faces it will literally one shot Heavies if it is close enough I believe it does around 4 to 500 damage if plac perfectly and considering heavy players have 350 Health it is a lot of damage hopefully this Tech will be Nerf soon but as of now it is extremely strong and you should be abusing it to win your game the other Gadget I always use is the Dome Shield it allows you and your team to shoot through it however the enemies can't shoot through it it's perfect for clutching up a few kills without taking damage or to force enemies to get up close to you and then when the closer you can either use your shotgun your Sledgehammer or an RPG to quickly eliminate them it might seem a bit overkilled to run the mes Shield and the Dome Shield at the same time but Overkill is exactly what you want Overkill is what makes it so difficult for enemies to defeat you now you need to be using these loadouts if you want to be winning consistently but there is a lot more to the game which is why you need to watch this video up on your screen now thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video,"The user appears to be quite experienced with the game, having played the finals nearly every day and testing everything the game has to offer. The user has discovered the best loadouts for every build, although acknowledges that these are not absolute as each player has a unique style. 

In terms of weapon balancing, the user suggests that most of the weapons for the light class are best used in close range battles. The user also recommends two specializations: the cloaking device and the evasive dash. The cloaking device is highly praised for its invisibility feature which makes it hard for enemies to see the player in the finals. This device is also useful for scouting enemies without being seen. 

The evasive dash is recommended for players with high-level movement and solid aim. The user notes that without these skills, a player's health points could deplete quickly. The evasive dash allows the player to dodge enemy fire while getting close enough to deal damage. 

The user seems to appreciate the strategic aspects of the game, particularly in utilizing these specializations to scout, evade, and attack. This suggests that the game provides a satisfying level of strategy and challenge. 

Overall, the user seems to enjoy the game and its current state, as suggested by their frequent play and detailed discussion of strategies. They also encourage others to like and subscribe to their videos, implying that they are committed to sharing their knowledge and enthusiasm for the game. The user opinion about weapon balancing in the game seems to be mixed. The user finds that the shotgun, melee weapon, and SMG are effective for quick eliminations, but only if the player has good aim. The user feels that heavy players are too powerful, as a single RPG rocket can defeat them. 

The user also discusses the grappling hook, stating that while it has some utility, it's not as beneficial as other specializations. The user suggests switching to using a medium and a jump pad instead for more health points and an advantage in battle.

In terms of weapon recommendations, the user seems to prefer the XP 54 SMG, which is easy to use and has a straightforward recoil pattern. The user is not as fond of the M11 SMG, stating that it is harder to use due to a lack of range, difficult iron sights, and an unpredictable recoil pattern.

The user also recommends the SH1 1900, a double-barrel shotgun, for the Le class. This weapon is effective for instant kills when used with a cloaking device or evasive dash. However, the user warns to immediately retreat after firing both shots.

In terms of the overall state of the game, the user doesn't provide a clear opinion. However, the detailed analysis of the weapons and their mechanics suggests that the user is engaged with the game and has spent considerable time understanding and mastering its systems. The user's suggestions for changes in the game mechanics, like the strength of heavy players Weapon Balancing Opinions:
1. The player is of the opinion that certain weapons are fun but do not have a meaningful place in a competitive setting, implying an imbalance in the effectiveness of various weapons.
2. The player believes the ""glitch grenade"" is overpowered (OP), as it can fully disable the opponents' abilities.
3. The player recommends using the ""stun gun"" due to its effectiveness in immobilizing opponents.
4. The player suggests using either ""breach charge"" or ""pyrro grenade"" gadgets, adding that the latter is particularly useful against gas grenades, a major counter to the light build.

Overall User Opinions on the Current State of the Game:
1. The player expresses a positive opinion on the ""healing gun"" and ""shields,"" which provide a strong defensive advantage over enemies.
2. The ""Recon sensus"" ability is highly praised for its strategical advantage, as it can reveal enemy locations across the map.
3. The player believes that effective communication and coordination among team members can significantly enhance the game experience.
4. The player suggests that the game's current state may favor those who effectively use the right abilities and weapons, pointing towards a strategic depth in the game.
5. However, the player's mention of overpowered elements and ineffective weapons indicates that they believe there are balancing issues that need to be addressed to improve the competitiveness of the game. The user has a high opinion of both the AKM and the F car in the game. They view the F car as an excellent weapon due to its easy-to-master recoil pattern, good optic, and high damage. However, they note the small magazine size (20 bullets) as a limitation. They recommend the F car for players who are confident in aiming and consistently hitting headshots. On the other hand, they praise the AKM for its larger magazine size (30-36 bullets), which is almost double the F car's capacity. They acknowledge that the AKM's recoil and iron sights are harder to use, but believe that players can easily adapt after some practice. An important advantage of the AKM mentioned is its high damage to shields, which is beneficial when playing against heavy players.

As for gadgets, the user strongly recommends using the defibrillator for its ability to revive teammates during battles. They also suggest using the heal beam immediately after reviving a teammate with the defibrillator, as it only restores around 40% of total health. The jump pad is also highly recommended for its utility in accessing high ground quickly and enabling heavy players, who lack mobility, to move around the map more efficiently.

Overall, the user seems satisfied with the game's current state, especially appreciating its weapon balance and the strategic use of gadgets. They encourage trying out different weapons and gadgets to find what suits each player's style the most.  However, they do not discuss any negative aspects The user seems to be providing an in-depth analysis of various aspects of the game. Regarding weapon balancing, they highlight the SA 1216, an automatic shotgun believed to have the highest damage per second, making it very powerful, especially in close-range fights. They suggest that combining this with a medium player healing can make the character even stronger. They also mention the LS gun, which is praised for its consistent damage, easy-to-control recoil pattern, and large magazine size. 

Regarding gadgets, they discuss several options, including the jump pad, explosive mind, APS turret, zip line, and gas grenade, depending on the player's style. The gas grenade is particularly favored as it forces enemies out of position and gives the player hit markers. 

For the specialization, the user expresses preference for the MES Shield, which can block incoming damage, making it a powerful option. 

The user's overall opinion seems to be positive, appreciating the wide range of weapons and gadgets available and their respective uses. However, it is not clear from the text whether they find the game balanced or unbalanced. They do not discuss any perceived shortcomings or areas for improvement, which suggests that they are generally satisfied with the current state of the game. The user seems to advocate for the use of the RPG weapon as a reliable means to inflict quick damage on enemies, particularly for heavy players. They consider it a great counter for lighter players. The C4 is also highly recommended due to its ability to perform what the user describes as the most overpowered trick in the game - attaching the C4s to explosives, then throwing and detonating them at opponents. This technique can supposedly one-shot heavy enemies and deal around 4 to 500 damage if placed perfectly. The user hopes that this technique will be nerfed in the future as it is currently extremely strong.

The Dome Shield is also favored as it allows the player and their team to shoot through it while preventing enemy fire. This feature is praised for its ability to secure kills without taking damage or forcing enemies into close quarters where they can be quickly eliminated with a shotgun, Sledgehammer, or RPG.

The user seems to appreciate overkill strategies, specifically running the Dome Shield and the Mes Shield together, as it makes it harder for enemies to defeat the player. Despite the effectiveness of these strategies, the user suggests there's more to the game that needs exploration.

Overall, the user seems to enjoy the game but also expresses concern about weapon balance, particularly the overpowered nature of the C4 trick. They suggest that to win consistently, players should utilize the mentioned loadouts."
The Finals Light Class guide,Qch7uif4UvM,the *NEW* LIGHT META in The Finals Season 4,in today's video we're going to be using what I think could be the new light meta right now in season 4 and I'm going to break down how to exactly use it effectively as always I'm going to be giving you guys a unique Inside the Mind look talking through what I'm doing in real time kind of letting you know why I'm doing what I'm doing throughout the entire game so let's get into it we're going to go ahead and head over to Vault number two here and really in this gameplay I want to focus on how to use this v9s pistol it's pretty decent at range and mid-range and it's really good up close so I'm going to try to break down how to exactly use it to the best of its abilities cuz I think it's probably the meta right now on light we're going to go ahead and hit a little invis stun play here on vault number two end up getting behind this purple player the staircase is really awkward for me oh my gosh I missed my window we end up getting the elimination teammate Chas him behind I'm going throw a frag and jump out the window see if he chases into that I don't get a hit marker so I don't think he chased so I'm going to end up backing up here see if we can kill this other purple player he hit the I guess grappling hook that was crazy all good though we're going to go I'm going to continue to chase this he's obviously going for the cash out so that he can get the bonus uh value for inputting it I hear him popping invis I'm not sure where he is here putting some pressure on why to just straight up steal this [Music] yeah they're playing so far off we'll just take a free steal why not I don't know what these guys are doing playing so far off the point we're able to just get a free steal I don't know why my teammate so uh being so aggressive off the point yeah now they're just spamming R Great oh my gosh I'm sorry for the annoying spam pings from this one teammate and I know he wants me to Res him but I have to go up top because they're going to steal if I don't get that another elimination I had a push because if we did I saw the other purple in this building down here if I didn't push that they were going to steal the point cuz we didn't have any teammates up here that's why I didn't go for the res sending a delivery trying to just buy time here create some chaos I know that they're trying to make a push here so I'm trying to play in a spot where I can easily get to the cash out but I'm not too overc committed to the point where they're just going to collapse in on us I was not ready right there so I back out I don't overc commit now I can go in try and get this elimination oh I missed my Jump by a mil no dude I got caught on the ledge I was going to drop down right behind him and get the free kill a little on lucky the one teammate is driving me a little crazy I can't lie spamming is super annoying for no reason but you're going to get teammates like that sometime when solo queuing even in rank so it's all good you got to learn to deal with them and I guess I'm also going to be able to Showcase that in this video also we have a triple light team that's again very unlucky I would hope that somebody would go medium or heavy but we all went light again is what it is going to go ahead and get this first elimination check we got two mediums left on on orange I'm going to grab my teammate and just insta go for the res I think this is oh what the heck not the play I guess throwing a frag throwing the frag to delay trying to get my teammate up on the third story here now we go for the res I don't think they'll Chase they might yeah they do ah I'm doing everything I can here oh I don't have a dash oh dude I tried everything man ah I just tried to I tried to get the res I maybe could have stuck it but it wasn't worth dying for cuz he would have just instant died and although this is a bit of a rough start I feel like I'm playing it pretty well and I think oh we got dudes on us my frag did not make it in there dely I'm stuck on a tree I can't see this dude there's so much I can't even move right now man this is super [Music] annoying I don't know what's going on this is so weird we get that elimination I'm not sure where everybody else went we go ahead and get the cash out started that was super awkward I didn't even really know what was going on to be honest with you guys um and what I was saying is even though this is one of those games where you get maybe some teammates who aren't really playing as a team or aren't really having the best game which is okay it happens you still have to be able to find ways to win solo by playing the point and knowing how to just play objective in this game so hopefully I can showcase that in this game where not the greatest start not the greatest teammates but we're going to lock in and get it done as a solo here I'm just dealing poke damage and you can see look at the range on this v9s man even from that super long range I got that guy half HP and that makes a big difference now that delays their push if they want to enter the fight we fall back because we were taking some pretty big damage and I think I'm going to pop an invis hop up here oh my gosh can I I can't make the jump I'm trolling that's all right we're going to go ahead and wrap around my dude kept sliding off the fence that's okay though sounds like my teammate's getting pushed so I'm going to dash through this window try to help him able to do just that that's a wipe on to purple which is big again not the cleanest fight there but hey you always got to stay locked in you always got to figure out what's the play no matter what happens if you mess up teammates mess up you got to stay locked in and make the right play so able to do that all good we should be able to secure Cash Out D here we might get one more push a team might respawn somewhat close and we might have to hold it off one more time but we're going to play this High Ground And if we need to it's easy to just drop in the hole and use the stun to get him off the cash out so we are being very aware of that all Al though I don't think I don't think actually there's enough time it looks like purple who was pushing us went over to Vault 5 I don't think anybody's going to mess with our cash out but again we're just playing this High Ground And if we need to we would just drop right down in here Dash on the point and use a stun to get somebody off the cash out so that's how I would have played it had somebody pushed but we don't even need it we go ahead and get the cash out and honestly kind of made up for the bad start we're back in it with six eliminations playing pretty decent and we're back in second place and now we can go ahead and move over to Vault 6 and look to start this and fight for this I'm going play this High ground and again use this v9s look how much damage I'm able to do from range this guy's actually already 1 HP we can also go ahead and break this heavy Shield this guy is also one HP this v9s is actually insane from long range and it's still really good up close that's why I think this might be the meta is you saw how much damage I'm able to deal from range oh purple rolling up we got to get out go ahead I forget that the frag canel cancels my invis trying to help my teammates we get that first elimination we get another one that's going to be a team wipe that was well played by my teammates I got kind of weak early into that fight that's why I had to drop out and I couldn't help my teammates but as soon as I was healthy I came back from The High Ground try to deal some damage but they handled that very well so good job by them and with this cash out you don't want to play on it because it's so in the open so we're going to go ahead and take this High Ground positioning this positioning is really good and really important if you try to play too close to this cash out you're just going to instant die but I do need to be very careful of my back here A Team could easily roll up drop a jump pad and come up behind me and I just instant die hear my teammate shooting so okay they're coming from over on this roof this is where we can use that oh oh oh my gosh that's exactly what I was talking about with the purple team roll up catch me off guard a little bit we go ahead and get that kill onto the light this medium's going to be like half HP I'm going to pop an invis I'm going to push this this guy was super low actually never mind I don't know exactly where he went don't want to overc commit go ahead and use a jump pad to get back on the power position on The High Ground don't want to overcommit too much and again with this v9s I think this shows off so well why I think this is so good the range on this thing is insane so you can melt up close and at range and that's something I don't think a lot of light weapons in the game currently have honestly I don't think there's a single light weapon other than maybe the lh1 that would be this good from range and up close orange team was pushing in we were in a perfect position in case they did didn't need to end up actually fighting there so we only had seven eliminations that first round so nothing too crazy but I think that really showed off how good the v9s is up close and at range and how you can use it at all times to really play the objective effectively even if your teammates aren't the best or maybe they are we had a triple light composition as well so really triple light should never win but because we played it so well and because the v9s is so good in so many situations we were still able to win that first round now we're going to head into round two moving over to Vault number one we going to have to drop down low here kind of tough to push in from up top this is absolutely chaotic the heav is weak though I should be able to get that elimination they might Chase here too so I'm going to throw the frag he does jump into the frag and he's 1 HP because of it played that pretty perfect oh this last guy was so low too we almost W V3 there man I actually played it so perfect with the frag grenade a really solid fight almost a 1v3 just just a little bit off we might have two teams that did not that might have been purple I'm not sure yeah it is two teams I'mma Focus this purple heavy get that elimination throw the frag cuz I saw a couple other guys over here get the elimination with the frag orange is WIP purple is wiped this is going to be a free point once the fire goes down who are we shooting at is there another team here maybe they resed I'm not sure it looked like two full team wipes on the leaderboard or scoreboard yeah I think it was I'm not sure what was going on there but hey we get the double team White playing that well focusing the purple heavy first and then using the fry grenade as we wrap back around maybe this little area right here we could play around and then jump on the [Music] point where's he stealing it from I I don't I didn't see this guy was he invis stealing wait I'm so confused I guess he was just in maybe he was like tucked here at the perfect angle stealing I honestly have no idea but but I was going for the stun to delay the cash out but I guess unfortunately I just couldn't see the guy so big mistake by me I'm sorry about that guys um but it is what it is we're going to have to bounce back and go ahead and move on over to Vault number three here trying to get this first Vault for that extra cash teammate oh I'm getting shot already I'm stuck man oh my gosh guys I'm sorry that's so frustrating I couldn't jump over that ledge for some reason my character got completely stuck this is not looking ideal but hopefully we spawn close to Vault 4 we're able to start that just go to C and get a cash out started here that would be really really big for us and we do get the good spawn so we're just going to have to race on over here this is going to be our one chance back into this game we're going to go ahead and hit this Gateway portal move on over to cash out C and even though this has not been the smoothest gamep play by any means I do want to still post this video for you guys because this is how it is when you solo K oh my gosh triple purple up top I'm dealing as much damage as I can I have to finish that thought after get the first elimination this guy's also one HP I'm pushing over onto him as fast as I can I didn't have another Dash tried to get in that window trying to figure out he dropped down low he going for the res no way I lose that how did I die what even killed me man 156 with a shotgun is crazy all good though teammates get the the last elimination and get the res and as I was saying this this is how it is man if you solo Q on light in ranked playing this style that I play you're going to have games that are just difficult and you're going to go through very ups and downs it's not always going to be the most perfect smooth game play so I think playing or posting I should say game plays like this is as important to show you guys how to work through those tougher games and still be able to find ways to win rounds orange pushing up behind here I'm going to use a frag to delay but I need to get out I'm going to throw another frag up top to try and do do some big damage not getting any hit markers unfortunately and I have to play this very smart I have to play the delay game I have a frag loading in soon hit the first stun did I get it I got it dude the frag went big that was just pure delay the only way we win that cash out is if I play that perfectly I time the fr grenade so that it was going to go off right before they get the cash out and even though I die there I do enough damage to the player trying to steal with the pistol so that the frag actually fully eliminates the player and we still get the cash out so that's again guys a perfect example and not the greatest game we're kind of struggling to find that momentum you can still make plays as a solo on light just like that to win rounds and and actually move on to the next round because of a play like that I don't know how this this guy isn't dead I just did so much damage to this [Applause] guy going for the res right now while they're stealing this is kind of a good window to try to get this res we're going to have to fight as a team anyways no point in me pushing in I'm taking so much damage already get that first elimination I don't have I'm running out of dashes we need to kind of get on this point now this pumpkin guy is so annoying yeah guys that is one of those tournaments everything went wrong that could go wrong for me man like the amount of times we died to just goofy stuff it's just going to be like that sometimes genuinely when you're solo queuing on light like this it's just going to happen where sometimes you just don't have the right team you don't have the right team composition or even with making as many plays as we did to try and pull it off somehow we weren't able to actually get the dub which is again unlucky but I think it's still important to share game plays like this with you guys so you can see that hey it's okay you're not always going to be able to find a way to win sometimes it's just not going to work out but if you consistently make plays like I was trying to make to delay cash outs and find ways as a solo to still win your team cash outs you're going to win more than you're going to lose that being said I hope you guys enjoyed this game play in this Inside the Mind look I appreciate all the love and support it truly means the world to me and I hope you guys have an amazing rest of your day I'll catch you in the next video peace,"The user thinks that the v9s pistol could be the new meta in the game's light category in the current season.

The Finals Medium Class guide,J4hY5VI-IN0,Medium Builds and Strategies - The Finals Guides / How to Guides Season 3,medium being the in between pick doesn't have the more apparent advantages that come with having the largest Health pool like heavy or highest damage output like light stat-wise it's middle of the ground in every way average Mobility average Health average damage so it makes sense for someone that knows nothing about the game to dismiss Medium as a class or contestant that has no advantages to offer and rather choose between the high health and high defensive capabilities of heavy or the high damage and high mobility of light depending on their preferred play style just looking at basic numbers medium might appear to be a class that serves no purpose but anyone that's actually played the finals knows that's not true what separates each class more than just the numbers are their specializations and gadgets and when throwing these into the mix the class's identities become much more distinct as of season 3 medium has three specializations that in my mind create three distinctively different play styles to choose from there's a supportive SL healer option a defensive SL lockdown option and what I'd call a more Mobility SL damage focused option all of which I think are viable ways to play if they're paired with the right gadgets my three strategies may not Encompass all possible play Styles but it's what comes to mind when I see each specialization you you may have your own strategies that differ from mine the builds and strategies I'll be going over are made considering cash out as a primary game mode but two of these builds can also work in terminal attack my preferred play style and the one I'd like to highlight first is the supportive option this play style involves using the healing beam as your specialization along with at least two supportive gadgets we'll consider the third Gadget slot to be a flexible slot that can vary from round to round and this will be true for all of our builds the gadgets you'd want for this play style are ones that support your team in some way the no-brainer choice is the defib and to be honest I think the defib is such a great Gadget that it's hard not to put in every medium build and the second supportive Gadget is the jump pad it's a quick to place Gadget that anyone on your team can use and it comes in handy for the support strategy that I'll explain in a bit an alternative to the jump pad is of course the zip line which serves a similar purpose a preference for the jump pad over the zip line simply comes from the fact that the jump pad is faster to place and you don't move in a forced slow and predictable path like you would with the zip line although there are places that can be too high or too far away to reach with the jump pad making the zip line necessary at times for my Flex Gadget I usually default a frag grenade cuz I like to have throwables but depending on the situation glitch traps are a great choice I'd use glitch traps in situations where I'm playing against a lot of lights with cloaking device or evasive Dash or even against other mediums that are using healing beam and defib since those are the players that rely the most on having their specialization at the ready and one good trap can ruin their day other than that this is the one slot that can be used for whatever you'd like the strategy for the support play style is that you want to be more of a follower going along with your team wherever they'd like to go and keeping a close eye on them without physically being too close to them ideally if your group is dying you want to be the the last one down because you should be the one keeping them up it can be a bit tricky switching back and forth from playing this way and playing as if you don't have the heal beam since you have to remind yourself that your team should be doing most of the heavy lifting in the damage compartment and you should be behind them they're off to the side keeping them alive as you're following it's best to prioritize shooting at the same targets as your team and centure behind them this should mean you'll generally be taking less damage in fights and you'll be able to see your team's Health to know when a fight is going south and you need to switch to your healing beam the most important thing to note about playing with the healing beam as your specialization is that if you're healing someone there's no need need for you to be out in the open as well while they're taking damage if there's an opportunity to sit behind some form of cover while you're healing then do it there's no value in standing somewhere where you can get shot and you can't fight back knowing when to switch off of your weapon to your healing beam and taking a back seat is the key to making this play style work it comes from deciding in the moment whether it would be more beneficial to heal in a given situation or if it would be more beneficial to damage now as far as why the gadgets I mentioned work well at this play style is that the defib obviously can revive people making it ideal for a Healer and support Focus strategy and I don't think it needs much more EXP than that as far as the jump pad or zip line other than being a gadget that everyone on your team can use it's also just a great repositioning tool for you when as I described earlier you're healing and don't want to be standing out in the open it can help you reposition to a distance that still works with the healing beam while also giving you a good vantage point to help in fights from a distance which brings us to our ideal weapon choices if you're playing from a distance doesn't make sense to use weapons that don't have any range so weapons like the riot shield or dual blades just aren't a good fit for this play style but I won't say there's any Perfect Weapon choice so just choose what you like what makes this my preferred play style for medium is that it's only possible to play this way on medium medium is the only contestant in the game that can heal their team and's the only one that can perform an instant revive maybe others will be able to do this stuff in the future but we'll have to wait and see whereas you can argue that the other strategies that I'll be describing can be mimicked to an extent by the other two classes now onto my second play style the defensive or lock down option involves picking the guardian turret of course and defending the objective whether you're playing cash out or terminal attack it's much easier to set this up in terminal Tech during the defense pre-round phase but other than it being more difficult in cash out or on the offensive side of terminal attack to set up the play style remains pretty much unchanged the gadgets you'd want to use are gadgets that are ideal for locking down an objective most importantly gas mines gas mines are what I'd say are the best of the mines to use for this lock down play style and I'll go into more detail as to why when discussing the overall strategy our second Gadget will also be mines but this time it's a choice between explosive mines or glitch trps between the two I usually gravitate towards explosive mines because I prefer the extra damage over the ability denial and combined with the turret and gas mines you can end up getting eims sometimes without even having to do anything as I said for the build the third slot is your choice but as I also said it's hard for me not to choose the defib since there's no other alternative to what it can do that being said there are some other good choices here such as the aps turret to help protect your setup or the other set of Mines that you didn't choose for your second slot now the strategy that I find most effective for locking down an objective is placing your gas mines on the objective itself just in case it ends up shifting around or being dropped to another floor the gas not only provides more area denial for a lockdown build but also denies your opponents from taking the objective even if your team gets wiped if your opponents don't have a way to counter the gas this could be potentially waste five or more seconds of their time depending on when each mine gets triggered also take into consideration that it takes about 5 seconds for a Cash Out Steel to finish and you're adding extra waste of time on top of that with these gas mines to make matters worse for your opponent the added annoyance from the guardian turret and another set of Mines can make stealing an objective feel hopeless for explosive mind placements I found the best spots are right after someone turns a corner since this game can be really fast-paced especially when you're playing right on an objective most people aren't going to be taking the time to clear Corners before running in and I find more success placing them this way than at entry points like I more commonly see them placed with glitch shaps you should be more concerned about placing them in spots to cover as much area as possible and keep in mind that you don't have to place them in spots that people tend to walk in order to activate them with how they work now as far as turret placement goes priority number one is that it needs to be in a spot that covers as much of the room as possible and priority number two is that you want it in a spot where it's hard to get a good angle to destroy it a good placement is a balance between the two protecting an indoor objective is easier but this strategy can work with an outdoor objective as well just not as great turret has pretty great range and if you're placing gas mines on the actual objective as I described this can be enough to keep it locked down it's a lot trickier to place your other set of mins but it's better to place them than to not as far as weapon choices the only one that I might stay away from is the cl40 just to not accidentally blow up any Minds I normally stick to ARS on medium but in theory the riot shield can work really well with this play style the only downside being when you don't have an objective you're locking down you're now stuck with a weapon that has no range a good alternative would be the model 1887 which has a surprising amount of range but it's still most effective from short to medium distances My overall opinion on this play style is that while it's great I tend to be too impatient at times to want to sit in the room with the objective waiting for people to push in so if you have a similar problem maybe try one of the other two play Styles instead okay now this last play style I haven't quite refined but I'd like to at least paint a picture of how it should work if played right it can be just as devastating as the other builds but it also has what I believe to be the biggest gap between skill floor and ceiling you'll be using the dematerializer as your specialization basically creating a build that makes you have extremely high area damage this build can also act as a counter to the lock down play style or any other team that's playing highly defensively the first first Gadget is going to be the frag grenade or pyro grenade and these are essential for tying this Build Together second will be explosive mines or gas mines but if you're using pyro grenades steer clear of using gas mines with them and your third Gadget can be a mine or throwable as well the defib or anything else you'd like but more mines or throwables would technically better complete the build the strategy is that you should be popping in and out of fights using the dematerializer to accomplish this and get a surprise angle or a quick escape on your opponents as you open your window with a dematerializer or find an existing opening for your surprise angle you'll have the opportunity to use a frag or pyro followed by your mind the frags with explosive minds work best for this strategy cuz if executed perfectly you can instantly delete someone or get them extremely low the frag will act as a Detonator for your mind rather than relying on the inconsistency of it getting tripped naturally you can also use the pyrro grenade as an alternative to the frag as a Detonator although it's a bit slower it's important to do this in the exact order I mentioned because the throwables take longer to throw than a mine takes the place saving you time and making it more difficult to get out of when doing it this way this is hard to pull off because you generally only get one opportunity to catch someone by surprise during a fight and swapping between your specialization two gadgets and then back to your weapon is a lot of inputs in a short time then of course if they move too much either only one or nothing will hit which is why this is great when playing against defensive teams chances are they'll have something placed down that can cause a chain reaction if you miss with your throwable while this can technically be done with any specialization being able to create an opening of your own means you can do this with more success than running into an existing opening and trying to toss a frag in mine at someone and since medium doesn't have any real ways to destroy walls other than the dematerializer at the moment it makes it the best choice if you're pulling off a quick escape the same thing can be done if your opponent tries to chase it catches people almost every time of course your priority should be to try and cut them off by closing a wall you've opened so they can't chase in the first place but if they do make it through you'll be ready tossing a throwable at your feet and then placing a mine shortly after Works nearly every time one of them will almost always hit this is way more consistent than the surprise angle it makes this build the best for personal survivability this build is centered around trying to wipe out a Target without giving them much of an opportunity to fight back which sounds great on paper but it is extremely difficult to pull off consistently I'm sure with enough practice ice though someone is going to get great at this if you prefer area denial over the high damage frag explosive mine combo then gas mines work better or pyrro grenades with explosive mines weapons of choice for this build are similar to The lockdown build anything works but unlike the lockdown build you want to blow up your mines so if the cl40 ever ends up getting a buff it would be absolutely deadly with this build the skill cing for this build is extremely high since a dematerializer is a very quick thinking specialization that requires a bit of creativity and you have to look at the maps and walls in a completely different way plus as I mentioned earlier swapping between your specialization two gadgets and your weapon it's a lot to do in a short time span I haven't used this build enough to claim I'm good at it but I know it can work better than I'm showcasing in this video to me medium specializes in filling in the gaps your team has whether that's a lack of Defense a lack of offense or a lack of support to tie your team together cuz more important than your own build Synergy is how well you're playing with your team despite medium's lack of High stats and health or damage you can make up for it with how you choose to play different players will gravitate towards a different one of these builds and because medium offers a taste of the other two classes with the defensive lockdown build and the ability damage build plus it has its own completely unique play style medium in my opinion is the best starter pick for anyone new trying to get into the game thanks for watching,"The user's opinions on weapon balancing revolve around the Medium class in the game. They believe that it is often overlooked due to its average statistics in terms of health, mobility, and damage, when compared to the Light and Heavy classes. However, they point out that the Medium class has unique advantages in terms of specializations and gadgets which can cater to different play styles. 

In the current sate of the game, the user reveals that Medium has three specializations - a supportive healer option, a defensive lockdown option, and a more mobility damage focused option. They argue that all these options are viable, differing only based on the gadgets paired with them. They also mention that these builds cater primarily to the cash out game mode, although two of them can also function in terminal attack.

Their preferred play style is the supportive option, which uses the healing beam specialization and at least two supportive gadgets. They also mention a flexible gadget slot that can change from round to round, implying a level of adaptability in their game strategy. Based on this, the user seems to appreciate the versatility and tactical depth offered by the Medium class, despite its seemingly average stats. The user expressed a preference for the defibrillator gadget, considering it a great choice for medium builds due to its supportive function. They also appreciate the jump pad gadget for its quick placement and utility to the team, although they acknowledge that the zip line might be necessary in certain situations due to height or distance limitations. The user prefers the jump pad over the zip line because the latter forces the player to move in a slow and predictable path. 

For the flex gadget, the user defaults to a frag grenade for its throwable function, but also sees the value in glitch traps, particularly against players using cloaking devices or evasive dash. The user points out that the gadget choice in this slot can be quite flexible, and should adjust to the situation at hand.

The user suggests a supportive playstyle, emphasizing the importance of accompanying the team and keeping them alive, while also avoiding direct confrontation. The user advises prioritizing shooting at the same targets as the team, highlighting the importance of coordination and shared focus in combat.

As for the overall state of the game, there is no clear opinion stated. However, the user's detailed description and analysis might suggest they find the game engaging and strategic, with a variety of choices in gadgets and playstyles. The user's opinions about weapon balancing are quite detailed. They note that weapons should match the play style and situation. For instance, if a player is healing from a distance, it makes little sense to use close-range weapons like the riot shield or dual blades. Therefore, the user believes that there isn't a ""perfect"" weapon choice, but rather a weapon choice that best fits the current situation. 

The user's overall opinion on the game's state is generally positive. They appreciate the strategic aspects of the game, such as knowing when to switch from weapons to healing, using cover to avoid damage, and the significance of positioning. They also find value in the game's unique features like the healing beam and gadgets like the defib and jump pad or zip line for reviving teammates and repositioning, respectively. 

However, the user does not provide any direct commentary on whether the current state of the game is balanced, satisfying, or needs improvements. The details given mostly revolve around strategic gameplay advice and personal preferences for playing the game. The user suggests the game has a degree of strategic depth, with different classes and playstyles. They appreciate the uniqueness of the instant revive feature, suggesting it's a powerful tool that other classes might not have. 

They find the defensive playstyle involving the guardian turret and gas mines particularly effective for objective control. The gas mines are considered the best for a lockdown strategy, providing area denial and preventing opponents from taking the objective. They prefer the explosive mines over glitch traps due to their greater damage output.

The user also appreciates the flexibility in building their character setup, although they find it hard not to choose the defib due to its unique ability. Yet, they acknowledge other good options such as the APS turret or additional mines.

However, the user doesn't mention any issues with weapon balancing, and overall seems to enjoy the strategic aspects of the game. They don't explicitly state their opinion on the current state of the game, but their detailed strategic analysis suggests they are engaged and invested in it. The user discusses various strategies for game-play, focusing primarily on the balancing of mines, turrets, and weapons. They feel that the gas mines can potentially waste a significant amount of time for opponents, adding an extra layer of difficulty on top of other tasks such as the Cash Out Steel. This, along with the additional annoyance from the guardian turret and other set of mines, can make stealing an objective feel hopeless for the opponent. 

The user suggests that the best spots for explosive mines are right after someone turns a corner, given the fast-paced nature of the game. They also recommend covering as much area as possible with glitch shaps. For turret placement, the user emphasizes the need for a location that covers the maximum area of the room and is also hard to destroy. 

In terms of weapon choices, the user advises against using the cl40 to avoid accidentally blowing up any mines. They usually stick to ARS on medium, but mention that the riot shield could work well with this play style, with the only downside being when you don't have an objective. 

In summary, the user believes the game currently has a strong emphasis on strategic placement of mines and turrets, and the choice of weapons can significantly affect game-play. They don't express any dissatisfaction with the current state of the game, but rather provide advice on how to navigate and potentially excel in it. The player expresses a few distinct opinions about weapon balancing and the overall state of the game:

1. Weapon Balancing: The player finds the range of certain weapons unsatisfactory, forcing them to remain locked down in a certain location. They suggest the Model 1887 as a good alternative with a surprising amount of range, although they note that it's most effective at short to medium distances. They also discuss the use of various gadgets and the dematerializer, indicating a preference for frag grenades or pyro grenades for high area damage. The player feels that the game allows for considerable skill differentiation, particularly with more complex strategies involving the dematerializer and various grenades and mines.

2. Overall State of The Game: The player seems to appreciate the strategic variety the game offers, with different playstyles that can be adjusted according to individual preferences and patience levels. They mention the potential for high defensive play, which can be countered by a certain build. They also find the strategy involving the dematerializer and grenades/mines to be potentially devastating if executed correctly. However, they do express frustration with the inconsistency of mines getting tripped naturally, suggesting some imbalance or flaw in game mechanics. The user seems to have a nuanced understanding of the mechanics of the game. They've outlined a strategy involving the use of specific weapons and gadgets, notably the pyrro grenade and a mine. They've detailed the importance of timing and placement of these tools, suggesting the pyrro grenade as a slower but effective alternative to the frag as a detonator. 

However, they highlight a challenge with this strategy - it requires a significant number of inputs in a short time, leaving little room for error. The player also points out that this tactic is most successful against defensive teams and can be thwarted if the opponent moves too much. 

In terms of weapon balancing, they mention that the medium class doesn't have many real ways to destroy walls, suggesting possible imbalance in the game design. They seem to advocate for the use of the dematerializer for this purpose. 

Overall, while they believe this strategy could be extremely effective with practice, they admit it's hard to pull off consistently. They seem to enjoy the game's complexity and the room for strategic depth it provides, but they also hint at possible improvements, particularly in terms of weapon capabilities and balance. The user has several detailed opinions about weapon balancing and the overall state of the game:

1. Frag Explosive Mine Combo: The user seems to be in denial over the high damage caused by this combo and believes that gas mines or pyrro grenades with explosive mines could work better.

2. CL40 Weapon: The user is anticipating a potential buff for the CL40 weapon, stating that it would be extremely deadly when used with the dematerializer build.

3. Skill Ceiling: The user notes that the game requires quick thinking, creativity and a different perspective of the maps and walls. They also point out that managing the specialization, two gadgets and the weapon is a lot to do in a short time span. 

4. Medium Build: The user believes that the medium build is ideal for filling in team gaps. They think that despite its lack of high stats, health or damage, medium build's effectiveness depends on the player's choices.

5. Team Synergy: The user emphasizes that synergy with the team is more important than individual build synergy. 

6. Starter Pick: According to the user, the medium build is the best starter pick for new players due to its versatility and unique play style.

7. Overall, the user seems to appreciate the game's complexity and variety of builds. They seem to enjoy the strategic aspect of the game and believe that success in the game is more about how well a player uses their build rather than the specific stats of the build itself."
The Finals Medium Class guide,7fmHOz7hPqE,The Finals #1 Medium Guide! How To Play Medium PRO Guide,"hello everyone welcome to the video and today we're going to be talking about a full in-depth medium guide for the finals so I have played a lot of medium I've also played a lot of light I made it all the way to Diamond mostly using medium class I only use medium in ranked pretty much because it's just really really good class and um I have a little over 11,000 kills as well with about a 3.2 KD and pretty much all of that is thanks to medium and light and today I'm going to be sharing with you guys a couple of the tips that I've found along the way to help me either rank up keep a high KD or just be as efficient as I can on medium in general so the first thing we're going to talk about is the load out that we're going to be running so it is going to involve Recon senses we're using the F car over the AK it is objectively better in pretty much every way other than mag size so just get good with the car the AK is bad once you start using this SC for so long you'll realize how much better it actually is in the AK and then we have jump pad and defibs which are not negotiable you are going to want to have those in the class no matter what and if you want to swap anything out I would say the frag grenade is the only one you can swap out you can swap it out for the gas mines explosive mines or even the zip line or APS turret but I think frag grenades are great because they work very well with Recon senses when you could see where people are coming from you can pre grenade like entryways and I'll show a couple of these strategies later on but frags just work so well with Recon senses in this game because you know exactly where to throw them and there's no grenade indicator so people don't know when there's a grenade there in a a lot of times they step on them and as for jump pads and defibs they are just absolutely crucial for the medium class and I would very much recommend not changing them out for anything and I'm going to talk about the scar a little bit because it is important to understand the recoil pattern a lot of times people accuse me of having anti-recoil scripts or cheats or whatever the case and it really does feel like it's a new cheat I'm being accused of using every single week but the reality is is that in the finals every single weapon has a 100% consistent recoil pattern so as you'll see on screen right now this is what it looks like when I'm not controlling the F car recoil pattern and this is what it looks like when I am controlling it it still moves around quite a bit and it's nothing too crazy but you can pretty much get the hang of any weapon I mean I've been using the F car for probably I don't know maybe 4,000 of my 11,000 kills have been with just this weapon so it's safe to say I've used it quite a bit and I understand the recoil pattern and it's pretty basic and very easy to control once you get the hang of it so I would h highly recommend to you guys to practice this in the range understand exactly how you're going to be using it and it will benefit you a lot in the long run next thing I want to talk about is a small little micro tip that I found out the other day and that's that you can cancel reloads so as you can see by this animation you can cancel your reload by just pressing your weapon bind for me it's triangle and you just press that whenever you're in a Reload animation it's pretty helpful a lot of times I tend to reload before someone dies and in that situation it's it's pretty helpful now we're going to quickly talk about jump pads jump pads um I feel like this is a very basic tip but sliding into jump pads will make you go farther as well as placing them on a slanted surface will make you go farther as well this is good for roofs in maps like Monaco now we're going to talk about grenades grenades are pretty self-explanatory for the most part but there is a secondary throw animation if you press L2 or right click you will underhand throw a grenade this is great for the stair trick that I'm about to show you essentially when you were running upstairs and if there's someone chasing you you can underhand throw these GR ades depending on how far the enemy is from you if you know they're like right behind you you can throw it up the stairs and they will walk into it or if they're a little bit farther behind you could throw it underhanded of course down the stairs and they will run into it I also show a stair climbing technique on the screen right now which is pretty useful as well for climbing stairs quickly later on in the video I'm also going to show you guys that clip of the grenade where I see people through walls with my Recon senses and I pread the doorway and just kind of wait there and someone steps directly on the nade and end up getting a a pretty free kill because of it and that happens probably multiple times a game where I'm able to do a significant amount of damage or get kills With Grenades so they're very very important to get used to using and now I'm going to talk about Recon senses very quickly because they're very self-explanatory essentially you're just not going to want to waste them so if you know where enemies are and you're not in fights it's probably better off to not be using them Recon senses are very self-explanatory they're literally wall hacks and it's almost hard to use them correctly however another little tip I have for you guys is a lot of times on very bright Maps because the lighting in this game is kind of pitiful but on these very bright Maps it could be kind of difficult to see people and for that reason if you pull out your jump pad screen you can actually inspect it and as you can see by the clip on screen you could see a lot better and um this is a very useful tip for just finding enemies whenever it's too bright on night Maps you don't really have to do this but it can even help probably in those situations as well and last but not least we are just going to talk about the positioning that you're going to want to have when you on medium you are pretty much always going to want to have high ground I mean when you have an AR with so much range so much damage very little damage fallof you have a jump pad that can give you free verticality whenever you want there's no reason for you to not always be abusing High Ground so just make sure you're always positioned on High Ground if you can be you can blow up points so that you have a vantage point above the point and you could shoot down with the scar just make sure you have clear losos and you're just going to be frying people so never leave High Ground don't drop down I do it all the time because I get kill hungry all the time but that's not how you play Medium you're not really going to want to be in 1 V one gunfights with people because sometimes it can be difficult to get out just be in an Untouchable position and be a literal Chopper Gunner but that's pretty much it for today's video If you guys found this video helpful make sure to drop a like as well as a sub about 99% of you guys are not currently subbed so let's make that number a little bit smaller together but again that's it for me so thank you guys again for watching and I'll see you time","The user seems to be very positive about the medium class in the game, having reached Diamond rank mostly using it and praising it as a ""really, really good class"". They have achieved over 11,000 kills and a 3.2 KD, attributing much of this success to the medium class. 

When discussing weapons, they state that the F car is ""objectively better"" than the AK in almost every aspect except magazine size. They encourage other players to get good with the car and avoid using the AK. They mention the SC as another weapon used. 

They also mention the use of specific in-game items: Recon senses, jump pad, and defibs. These are considered non-negotiable and essential for the medium class. The frag grenade is also recommended due to its synergy with Recon senses, allowing the player to anticipate enemy movements and throw grenades accurately, but it can be swapped out for other items like gas mines, explosive mines, the zip line, or APS turret. 

Overall, the user has a positive view of the current state of the game, at least in terms of playing as the medium class. They seem to prefer certain weapons over others and appreciate certain game mechanics, like not having a grenade indicator, which can give strategic advantages. The user provides detailed opinions on weapon balancing, particularly focusing on the recoil pattern of the F car weapon. They express that the weapon's recoil pattern is 100% consistent and easy to control once understood. They have used the F car extensively, attributing around 4,000 of their 11,000 kills to this weapon, indicating a level of satisfaction with its performance. They also appreciate the ability to cancel weapon reloads, which they find beneficial in certain combat situations. 

They also mention the use of jump pads and grenades, providing helpful tips for maximizing their utility. The user's opinion on these game mechanics appears to be positive, as they offer strategies to maximize their effectiveness. 

Overall, the user seems to have a positive opinion on the current state of the game, sharing strategies and tips for various game mechanics, including weapon handling and utility usage. There are no explicit complaints or suggestions for improvement mentioned. The user seems to have positive opinions about the use of grenades in the game, finding them significant for damage and securing kills. The user's opinion about the Recon senses is that they are helpful and straightforward, but advises against wasting them when the player is already aware of the enemies' locations. The user also shares a tip regarding the use of jump pad screen to spot enemies better on bright maps, suggesting a potential issue with the game's lighting. However, the user doesn't specify any opinions about weapon balancing. Overall, the user seems to enjoy the game and provides helpful tips for other players. The user's opinions on weapon balancing seem to focus on the power of the AR (Assault Rifle), which they believe has too much range, damage, and very little damage falloff. This suggests that the user feels the AR is perhaps overpowered, which may impact the game's balance negatively. The user also mentions the use of a jump pad that can give free verticality, implying that certain items or abilities in the game can provide significant advantages in combat.

Regarding the overall state of the game, the user advises players to always seek high ground and avoid 1v1 gunfights, suggesting that the game's current state favors strategic positioning over direct combat. Furthermore, the user seems to enjoy the game, given the advice and strategies they share, even though they believe certain aspects could be better balanced.

However, it's important to note that the user does not provide explicit feedback on the game's overall state, and the extracted opinions are based on their gameplay advice and strategies."
The Finals Medium Class guide,XBN9QUiut4s,The ULTIMATE guide for the MEDIUM CLASS in The Finals!,so the medium class is potentially the most used Class in the finals I obviously don't have the numbers but it is the class I feel like I see the most and it is definitely one of the most crucial when it comes to team play and winning games so today we're going to be going over a fundamental guide on how to play the medium class now I've already done this for the light class and I will be doing it for the heavy class in the next couple of videos so if you are new around here be sure to subscribe for more finals content but with that being said let's get stuck right into it now start stting off with the overall play style you mostly want to sort of consider yourself a support/ medic type of class yet at the same time you are also very solid when it comes to dealing damage and getting kills as well now in my opinion the medium class does take a lot of thought to play properly it's not the type of class you can just equip and then run around and do whatever you want you kind of always have to be on the ball switching between trying to deal damage and push objectives and stuff like that but also constantly changing your mindset at the flea a switch slowing down trying to survive and then healing or Reviving your teammates you almost just have to always be switched on and always be really focused and just have General good awareness if your awareness in this game is not very good then I would honestly recommend picking a different class most likely the heavy class essentially you just need to stay focused on more than just yourself you definitely need to keep all of your teammates in mind knowing pretty much where they are at all times so that you can heal them up and revive them if you need but then also on the flip side of that if all of your focus goes into your teammates and you just sitting there healing your heavy without doing you know any damage yourself that is also not helpful either so it is a bit of a balancing act and it can definitely be a little bit hard to get the hang of compared to some of those other classes now moving on to the I guess load out side of things and starting off with the specialization breakdown I will straight up say it unless one of your teammates has the heel beam and is really good with it you should pretty much always run the heel beam in my opinion yes the turret is very solid to be honest for defending objectives and yes the Recon senses are also really really good for awareness and helping to communicate with your team where the enemies are but in my opinion the heel beam is a clear number one and to be honest even if your teammate has the heal beam as well I think I would still recommend also running the heal beam it is just so clutch especially if you can pair it with someone else using it too you can have essentially unlimited health and that can really help especially if you've got a heavy on your team keeping them constantly alive and just letting them soak up all the damage while you get a few kills and then simply heal them up and get them back to full health now moving on to the weapon side of things it is in my opinion kind of the same situation that I just mentioned I think that at least for me anyway the akm is by far the best of the mediums weapon choices and it is the one that I would definitely recommend at least starting off with and obviously it is the default so I'm going to assume most of you have started off with this weapon now with that being said the fkart is also really good but it is just a little bit more risky if you do miss your shots having only 20 rounds in a magazine that is definitely not handy if you are missing shots and even if you do hit all of your shots you can't really like spray transfer in the same way that you can with an akm where maybe you've taken out one enemy and then you can kind of flick to the next enemy and try and deal a bit of damage most of the time if you are killing an enemy with the F car you pretty much have to reload almost instantly on top of that as well even though the F card definitely deals a bit more damage it does have a slower rate of fire and I'm going to be doing a series where I actually break down all of the stats and stuff for every single weapon but the stats that I do have so far prove that it takes about 34 of your magazine with the fcar to kill a heavy yet it only takes about half of your magazine with the akm to kill a heavy as well even though obviously it takes more bullets with the akm it's still a half of your magazine compared to 34s so that is pretty much a prime example of what I mean that being said it probably sounds like I'm saying the FK is bad it is definitely not it's still very from the use but I do just think the akm is a little bit better as for the other weapon choices I do think that the model 1887 and the r357 are also really solid but but they are just a little bit more Niche I guess so they are more of a personal preference if you really enjoy that type of play style either using a shotgun and getting up close even though that does actually have some really solid range on it or maybe sitting a little bit further back with the r357 then obviously those are still very useful and if that is your play style I would definitely run them as well like I said though I do just feel as though the akm is essentially the Jack of all trades but it isn't the master of none as that saying goes because I do still think it is probably the best weapon in a lot of situations to now moving on to the gadgets and the gadgets that I like to run for the medium class are the gas grenade the defib and the jump Pad but to be honest there are so many good gadgets for the medium class that it is really hard to say the jump pad can be replaced by the zipline for example for a little bit more horizontal movement because obviously the jump pad it is really good for your movement but it is mostly vertical unless you can put it on an angle and then on top of that you can definitely replace your gas grenades for example with any sort of mine or even just the other grenades too or even even the sonar grenade is really solid too for a bit of Team awareness so again it is just down to personal preference but pretty much everything I mentioned there is definitely worth giving a shot and just seeing which ones you like the most but for me it is the gas grenade the defib and the jump pad now the one that you cannot play with though in my opinion is the dpib I would argue that this is the most crucial Gadget in the entire game across all of the three classes and that is especially the case when it comes to tournaments because you obviously have limited revives and so it is an absolute must in the tournaments and especially ranked tournaments too so definitely run with the defib if you're not going to use the defib I would honestly just go ahead and pick a different class to be honest I really see no reason to be playing the medium class unless you are using the defib and like I mentioned before I feel about the same about the heel beam but probably not as strong because the turet is also really good so keep in mind that the medium class is definitely the best because of the de fib and because of that heal beam as well now as for some K tips through remember when you are playing as the medium class the main one is realistically just to stick with your teammates at all times especially when it comes to your heavy or even your other mediums obviously the light class has a little bit more freedom to kind of run off and be a disruptor so often times you just have to let your light player go and let them do their thing but if you're not close to your teammates for example your Heavies and your other mediums you are not nearly as effective one of your strongest points is as I mentioned the heal beam and the ability to very quickly revive teammates and if you're on the other side of the map then obviously that is completely useless so you may as well like I said pick a different class if you are not sticking with your teammates something else that is definitely worth getting in the habit of doing is just constantly healing your teammates at pretty much any chance that you can get if your teammate takes how 20 damage pull your heal beam out heal him switch back to your gun get in the habit of doing that at all times it takes literally like 3 seconds to half heal your teammate's health and then get your gun back out that is going to cause you to win so many more gun fights as a team and once you get to the point where it becomes a habit more than actually something you have to think about it is borderline overpowered in my opinion so definitely get in the habit of doing that it is going to make your teammates absolutely love you and you guys are definitely going to win more games than not now with all of the support Focus aside you still want to try and get your share of kills and damage dealt as well even though that can be a very tough Balancing Act you do still have decent movement as a medium you get stuff like a jump pad for example to increase that even further and so you can can definitely still have that slight little bit of I guess a Slayer role incorporated into your play style so long as you don't overdo it like I said first and foremost you want to be making sure that you are supporting the teammates but if you just sit there with the heal beam literally the whole game and heal your teammates that is not as useful as you can be when everything is kind of clear in terms of healing and Reviving you can definitely still be very solid when it comes to getting kills and dealing damage so that is something you should try and focus on as well and kind of get the balance right there in terms of balancing that support role as well as the Slayer role too I ke to hear your thoughts though guys let me know of anything in this video that you disagree with or any tips of your own for those reading the comments I'm always Keen to hear your thoughts but with that being said thank you all very much for watching you guys have a great day and I'll see you all out there in the arena,"The user seems to have a high opinion about the ""medium class"" in the game, indicating that it is potentially the most used class and is crucial for team play and winning games. They also suggest that the medium class is more of a support or medic type, but also efficient at dealing damage and getting kills. They find that playing the medium class requires constant focus and strategic thinking to strike a balance between dealing damage, pushing objectives, and healing or reviving teammates. They advise that players with poor awareness may be better off choosing a different class, likely the heavy class. They emphasize the importance of being mindful of teammates' locations and statuses, but also caution against focusing too much on healing teammates without doing any damage. They describe it as a balancing act that can be challenging but seemingly rewarding. There's no explicit comment on weapon balancing, but they imply an importance of balance in gameplay. The user seems engaged and constructive towards the game's current state but suggests it might require a level of strategy and awareness that could be challenging for some players. The user's opinion on weapon balancing and the current state of the game is as follows:

1. Specialization: The user strongly recommends the use of the heal beam. They believe it to be vital in the game, even if another teammate is already using it. They argue that having essentially unlimited health, especially when paired with a heavy class, can be a game-changer. They also mention that the turret is solid for defending objectives and the Recon senses are beneficial for team awareness, but the heal beam is a clear favorite.

2. Weapon Choices: The user prefers the AKM among the medium weapons. They believe it's the best due to its default status and easier handling, recommending it as the starting weapon for most players. They also mention the Fkart as a good weapon, but consider it riskier due to having only 20 rounds in a magazine. This limitation makes it less forgiving of missed shots and less versatile in situations where the player has to engage multiple enemies in quick succession. 

Overall, the user seems to appreciate the strategy involved in the game and has clear preferences in terms of loadouts and weapon choices. The user's overall opinion of the game appears to be positive, though they might appreciate more variety or balance in weapon choices and specializations. The user believes that the game needs some weapon balancing. According to them, the F card deals more damage but has a slower rate of fire, requiring 3/4 of the magazine to kill a heavy. On the other hand, the AKM can kill a heavy with only half of its magazine, highlighting an imbalance despite needing more bullets. Despite this, the user clarifies that the F card is not bad and is useful, but they feel the AKM is slightly better. 

The user also mentions two other weapons, the Model 1887 and the r357, which they believe are solid options but more niche, as they cater to specific play styles. The Model 1887 is useful for an up-close play style, while the r357 suits players who prefer to stay back. 

The user praises the AKM as a versatile weapon, useful in many situations. They also discuss different gadgets for the medium class, such as the gas grenade, the defib, and the jump pad. However, they believe that there are many good gadgets for this class, making it hard to definitively choose the best one. They suggest the zipline as a possible replacement for the jump pad for more horizontal movement.

Overall, the user seems to enjoy the game but feels there are areas, particularly in weapon balance, that could be improved upon. The user's overall opinion on the current state of the game seems to be generally positive. They have commended the variety of grenades available such as the gas grenade and the sonar grenade, stating that they are worth trying out and add to the game's depth and strategy. However, the user has a strong preference for the gas grenade, the defibrillator (defib), and the jump pad.

In terms of weapon balancing, the user believes that the defibrillator is the most crucial gadget across all three classes, especially in tournament play due to the limited number of revives. They feel so strongly about the defibrillator that they suggest choosing a different class if a player is not going to use it.

The user also mentions the heal beam as a strong feature of the medium class, but they do not feel as strongly about it as they do the defibrillator. They also mention the turret as a good option. The user believes that the medium class is the best, primarily due to the defibrillator and heal beam.

The user also offers some strategy tips, emphasizing the importance of sticking with teammates when playing as the medium class. They note that the light class has more freedom to disrupt, but the medium class's strength lies in its ability to quickly revive teammates and heal them with the heal beam. If the medium class player is not near their teammates, these abilities become useless. They suggest picking a different class if a player is not going to stick with their team. The user believes that the balance between healing and combat is pivotal in the game. They find the healing aspect to be highly effective, even to the point of being ""borderline overpowered"", and they encourage constant healing of teammates. However, the user also suggests that being too focused on healing and not participating in combat is not beneficial. They believe that contributing to the fight is important and that a balance between the supportive role and the ""Slayer"" role is essential. They mention that the game allows for decent movement, like using a jump pad, which can aid in achieving this balance. Overall, the user seems satisfied with the game's current state, but they do not provide specific feedback on weapon balancing. The text provided does not contain any specific opinions about weapon balancing or the overall state of the game. Please provide a detailed text discussing these aspects for analysis."
The Finals Medium Class guide,81CpaQSUMG8,How to Win More with Medium Class – The Finals Pro Tips,medium is the most used Class in the finals right now I think and after close to 650 hours in the game I want to share the things I've learned Ming medium and high level lobbies but before you jump in the arena make sure you know what you're up against one of the things I like to do is check the leaderboard before getting into the game this way I know which classes I'm up against and I can choose my counter weapons and gadgets if I see a lot of lights in my Lobby for example I'll choose between the F card the revolver or the model 1887 because I counter best lights with those weapons one of the most interesting things I found about this game is how Embark managed to make the medium a support class while also acting as an assault class you can do just as much damage if not more than a heavy or light while still supporting your team more than they can this brings me to the heal beam I've seen a lot less medium players use the heal beam after their season 4 Nerf but it's still an extremely powerful tool for the medium class I'm sure we've all been against a three medium heal beam circle jerk before I'm back circle jerk circle jerk circle jerk circle jerk circle jerk but remember you don't always have to be aggressive as medium you can hang back with the heal beam and watch the show I'm healing you bro I'm healing you bro I'm healing you bro it's all you bro nice another thing you can do with the heal beam is the body block heal Strat that I'm sure you've all encountered before which is also really good for the last second steals but hey if you're not a heal beam guy that's okay with me you have to find the best specializations and gadgets that fit your play style I personally like to stay alive as long as I can so I've been using a lot of things to keep me alive like the goo grenade and dematerializer as of recent Staying Alive while dealing damage to your opponents helps your team a lot because even if you can't finish someone off on your own your team is there to help you and if one of your teammates go down you can defib someone and keep them alive speaking of staying alive make sure you're using your movement and gadgets to outplay your opponents this is especially useful when fighting in buildings cuz the enemies never expect a window jump when I'm being chased utilize your gadgets use Goo or grenades or flashbangs whatever you need to help stay alive this kind of goes for every class but let's say you aren't running the right gadgets or you ran out well using the canisters around the map is extremely underrated I've gotten out of so many situations where I should have died but a trusty goo canister or red canister was there to save my life when I should have very easily died for all you AR users make sure you learn The Recoil pattern of your gun with that said I don't even fully know the recoil pattern of every gun I have the memory of a goldfish but I do remember the F car pattern because all the bullets do is go up to the right slightly this one was very easy to learn for me and with the season 4 update allowing me to remove the scope the F car has become a lot more satisfying to use so before jumping into a game check out the patterns in the practice range or do what I do and just shoot a wall when you join a game for a quick reminder of The Recoil pattern remember that Medium is a support class so if you're the type of player that likes defending cash outs then don't be sleeping on the mines sometimes you can get away with some pretty ridiculous things a man uh on that the will have to oh my God oh my oh my no [ __ ] way dude that's wild that is insane the glitch mine is still very powerful despite its season 4 Nerf you only get one but you can place two on the map once it's done charging up throwing a glitch mine on a statue is a great counter to other mediums and it's one of the most frustrating things they can encounter going for a defib on your teammate and being glitched and switched to your primary weapon is not a good time team coordination is huge in this game and I I get it solo cubing is tough but try to find someone you played well with and AD them having your team all push someone is easily one of the best ways to win and having coordination and trying out different things may surprise not just your team but you as well you're going to jump head up break through the window and place two turrets all right okay here hold on hold on wa wait so I'm going to place this jump Pad Place the turrets then we're going to go around over that side and you're going to jump P okay yeah yeah all right okay let's go turret jump drop all right now come back there I a jump pad right here moving follow go flank oh my God please oh my God oh my God what the [ __ ] dude so there you have it that's how you use medium get creative use your movement and support skills to your advantage keep your team alive and have some fun if you enjoyed the video consider leaving a like And subscribe for more finals content also leave a comment below if you found some tips and tricks you want to share

The Finals Medium Class guide,xFweVI3V5IU,How to MASTER Medium Support Guide | The Finals Pro Gameplay Coaching,I'm the gum buuck this is the finals and in this video I'm going to show you how to be a medium Master support I'm going to talk about the dos the don'ts the things I did right and the mistakes I made I'm on a team we've got a random heavy here I'm paired up with a light um you I'm rocking the akm defib jump pad and frag grenade of course I've got that heal beam so we're pushing up on the point oh snap okay we got something located I'm trying to lay down some fire I'm backing up I'm going to let the medium push up and just kind of sit back for a support pull my heel beam out let them kind of work I'm going for a flank here so I'm hoping that they can maintain while I come around trying to get some shots from a far stick the heel Beam on my light come on light Let's Stay Alive here all right going to reposition up to the roof taking that jump pad just for that maneuverability that's nice all right so I banged out in assist there dropping down putting down some suppression fire let's toss some frag nades in there again I'm letting uh letting that heavy be up front he's rocking the uh flamethrower so he's kind of a close range he's got a close range build and I'm going to push up to get him healed back up want to get this want to get my light back alive pull him out I'm going to stick him for the res there in a second but let's get this guy down so pushing up going back for the flank and uh the light revived but looks like the heavy managed to finish that guy off I believe so I'm going to grab this uh flame bang and try to inhibit them from following light wraps that ties someone was trying to come up behind us in light just wrapped him up so let's go all right now we've got the Vault we're pushing cash box a we're going to go plant this B uh heav is going up the stairs I don't know why he didn't take the zip would have been a little faster wouldn't it so I'm going to try to block off some paths there uh try to isolate the lanes that people can attack this cash box that way we have a better idea of where they may be coming from uh I'm going to grab a gas I think I wanted to gas the point here but then I changed my mind I was going to gas this guy all right so I throw that over there try to get some shots off on him he drops down and you know I'm just trying to keep a you know an eye on the uh health bars of my teammates there on the bottom left got a guy on cat on point pushing up for the support switch to the hill beam I'm going to just let this heavy do his thing all right that that went pretty good there so we've got this point here they uh magenta Pops in throwing some nades just trying to again you see my position it's all about the position I'm sitting back I'm letting heavy do the Frontline stuff heel beaming heel beaming push up with that flame throw he's got that close range attack he's pressuring I'm chasing we're going to wrap that up all right that's a team wipe right there orange is uh on The Fray the heavy did come down after me that was a good move on him we had some really good Synergy even playing with this Rando in terms of like pocketing pocketing is a term uh maybe I coined it but it's just really sticking to super hard sticking together beating each other's back pockets got orange pushing up heavy clears the gas with his flames and I'm just trying to make sure all my team is always full HP if I can get another assist there while that light does his thing they're trying to come up from the hole in the uh ceiling there so um the flame flamethrower heav pushing them back trying to keep them at Bay I'm just going to throw that Beam on him in case they try to put some suppression fire and they didn't seem like they did so uh oh oh light light goes up top to finish it up that's a great flank by our light and it seems like we are holding this down pretty pretty well ladies and gents all right so Heavy's Heavy's taking it he seems like he's in good condition he's going up the stairwell all right someone's dropping someone's above again I'm going to I know got some shots on him clean that kill up nice and dandy checking everything out making sure we got the lay to land there and we do we do nice so we dominated that cash boox and oh teammates getting into the fight here so I'm going to help them out manage to wax that dude let's let's go pushing up throwing the heel beams on again you see my positioning right so if you want to be a master medium support it's all about positioning you need to be in a place where you can deal damage but also give support to your team in way of the heals boom jump pad zip let's go movement Tech if you don't know if you're not doing that go ahead and hit that jump pad zip all right to get out of the hospital a little bit a little bit more quickly so again communicating I see that my light got hit cuz I'm watching those health bars the whole time in the bottom left I'm paying attention also to my teammates health bars that's game awareness they get hit I know that the that they're engaging and I can move to support so I'm going to go flank this guy easy wrap up there but I hit the land mine uh but you know the heavy smart smart guy clears that gas for me real quick even though I walked over the other mine but we're not going to talk about that and we're going to push up for this next Vault oh oh what was this guy doing he comes back we get that team shot elimination I'm going to quickly get my uh light back up to fighting weight make sure his HP is all the way back up just in Cas for another engagement and he manages to finish up this little straggler orange and that's I believe another team wipe oh wait no there he is he comes over he makes it I couldn't believe that we couldn't double tap that zip to remove it so he would have fallen to his demise but nonetheless we're pushing up in here our heavy is getting hurt so we're going to try to pay attention to that we're all going to reposition Oh I thought he was right there that's my mistake but we're gonna go up quickly to try to support him and get pocket back up again so he's doing his thing with the close range flame and I want to throw that heel Beam on him so he can just mash it was a 1 V one there so in that situation I definitely want to heal beam him sometimes you got to make a call whether it's uh 2v two or Pardon Me 1 V2 meaning heavy or 1v3 so heavy versus three and whether you uh applick damage or you apply heals so again we got that easy steel I was positioned to lay down some frag nades but also hit the heel Beam on the heavy to support his steel if he need needed it and uh so we get that steel before the cash out is even at the quarter of the time Mark and I think we just hit that so now it's just hold it's just aiming bang baby so again look at my positioning we got the tripod here this is uh Phil Jackson's the Chicago Bulls it's the triangle defense all right so I'm going to push up get some heal beams come on heavy come on get my range there we go there we go let him do his thing let him do his thing he does oh okay oh this is awkward he gets that res off this guy oh this guy's getting away no sir not today not today friend I go up to finish that kill cuz I'm a shark and I smell blood and water now we're going to reposition here to focus back on the cash out make sure that it's protected and it looks pretty safe so but look at this positioning ladies and gentlemen this whole video is all about the position I'm right behind my team I'm able to support all right putting some shots down switch to heel beam throw some nades helps with suppression heal beam heal beam heal beam there you go there you go look at that all right he's racing he's got full health so I I was going to switch to my weapon to help lay that suppression fire to catch him if my heavy couldn't with his Flames cuz he's got limited range whereas I got I don't have as much limited range now we only have a quarter less than a quarter left throwing some nades make sure you guys are using your utilities guys don't sleep on utilities constantly be spamming them spam your utilities use them at the right time right position pull the gun out to lay suppression cuz my heavy got good HP trying to build his HP back up as we push and look look at that we've got this W that's a zero death W five kills 12 assists zero deaths if you love the finals like I do stay tuned because there will be more content coming

The Finals Medium Class guide,P7wVJgmYQkY,Ultimate MODEL 1887 Masterclass Guide &amp; Aim Training! | The Finals Season 3,I got to be honest with you guys learn this shotgun had its ups and downs or to be more accurate felt like I was on a roller coaster some days I would pop off and on other days I felt like I could have hit a shot for the life of me but once I learned what made this weapon tick and how to bring consistency to the table I started to get some serious results so in this master class I'm going to show you all the ins and outs of the 1887 shotgun what type of play style that will give you the best chance of winning how to use on maps that highly favor range weapons what specialization and gadgets to pair with it and lastly how to train with it so you can bring out its full potential on a daily basis so before we get started if you found this video informative please don't forget to smash that like button before you leave it's a small button for you but makes a massive impact on my channel it allows me to keep doing things that I'm doing and providing you with the best content possible also subscribe Arena notification Bell for all things to finals let's get into it now as we all know if in the right hands this shotgun is a beast close to mid-range pumping out 160 damage per second it can demolish a medium and light with two shots in 58 seconds and a heavy with three shots at 1.58 seconds now on paper you'll see that this weapon doesn't really look that impressive especially when comparing it to powerful weapons from other classes however what makes this weapon shine Above the Rest is that it provides you with the ability to run and Gun in the truest sense allowing you to utilize the movement speed of hip firing while also gaining the accuracy that aiming down sights would provide allowing you to outmaneuver your opponent while punishing them for every shot missed with immense burst damage but with all the good this weapon has to offer it it does have its drawbacks first is the time to reload I can't tell you how many times I left the opponent with the sliver of health because my reload animation would not allow me to fire it's quite frustrating but fortunately for us until it is fixed there is an easy way to work around it and that is to Melly cancel the animation allowing you to fire the last shot needed to take down your opponent the second is tracking fast opponents at extremely close ranges for example a sword light using Dash or any one of the close- range high damage weapons in their Arsenal if you're able to increase your efficiency in that area of tracking everything else becomes easy with this weapon in fact I would go as far to say that this one aspect is what separates a good shotgun player from a great one but don't worry I've got a training routine later in this video that's going to help you step up your 1887 game guaranteed before we jump into the practice range though let's go over some important aspects which is play style now there are maps in this game that highly favor this weapon giving you lots of opportunities to engage in close-range combat allowing you to use this gun as intended however there are maps with long corridors a lot of open space with very little cover and will provide very little opportunity organically to close the gap to eliminate your Target in these Maps the two important factors that you need are patience and Mobility I can't tell you how many times I spectated players get so kill hungry that they completely disregard their cover and run through long Open Spaces in order to challenge an opponent that has a weapon that gives them clear range Advantage only to get eliminated by either the opponent they're chasing or their teammate which is most likely firing at them from their flank patience plays a huge role here you need to learn how to live to fight another day to retreat reposition and and utilize cover and enclose routes as much as possible always limiting the amount of time that you are exposed out in the open now I understand to some this may seem like a boring slow way to play but the good news is medium has gadgets such as jump pad and zipline as well as a specialization dematerializer that will help make closing the Gap that much easier essentially cutting the time it takes to get to your opponent in half abilities like these make it incredibly easy for the player to strategically make their way to the most advantageous position before engaging the enemy whether it be running straight through a building with a dematerializer breaking line of sight with a jump pad or zip line to move vertically onto a higher level or you could even use a zip line to Traverse faster horizontally again abilities like these are essentially what makes the medium shotgun extremely effective in just about every map and with a competent team that can provide shielding distraction and cover fire the 1887 shotgun becomes a force to be reckoned with now you don't necessarily need to have all three of these abilities to be effective just one to two would be enough for example I prefer using the turet gun coupled with the jump pad and zipline or you could even use the dematerializer to run straight through buildings you can mix and match these abilities as you see fit so that you can use a Loadout that is most fitting to your play style with that being said though nothing I just mention will work for you if on average you are landing 40% of your shots per mag this weapon rewards you for precision remember you only have six bullets to get the job done so you will be severely punished for any inaccuracies each missed shot will raise your ttk drastically so before we hop into the firing range I want you to keep a few things in mind the first is to utilize hip fire for the entirety of this training routine whether you are engaging in mid or close ranges the reason being is because you do not receive any inaccuracy penalties when hip firing and the bullet spread Remains the Same whether you are on hipfire or an ads this will allow you to move faster make you more aware of your surroundings and evade shots thus increasing your survivability for those of us that are used to automatic weapons this will take a little time to get used to because we've made a habit of aiming down sights for targets that are just outside of close range however I promise you that once you get used to shooting this way your Effectiveness with this weapon will double the second is to prioritize accuracy and smoothness over speed what I mean by speed is trying to look flashy and flicking your shots this will not only create bad habits but will also make your aim unreliable and basing your daily performance off of luck rather than skill essentially I want you to move smooth and accurately from shot to shot or from Target to Target so that you can eventually move fast and maintain that level of smoothness and accuracy I want you to remember this smoothness will always equate to speed so with that being said let's jump into it now as you already know if you watch any one of my master class videos we will always start with centering as a warm-up but this time there's a little bit of a Twist first start by centering one of the very many stationary Targets in the practice range for 3 minutes stay in Hip fire making long 1second strides from left to right while moving into close and mid-ranges and mixing it up a little by throwing in a couple of crouches after you are done with that I want you to make your way to the roof of the building and spend 3 minutes here centering this light moving Target at extremely close ranges moving around it and trying to keep it in the center of the screen as much as possible this war warm up and the scenario to follow are extremely important because this weapon does not have a lot of weaknesses when it comes to close-range engagement but I promise you the one Bane to your existence when running this shotgun will be a competent light utilizing Dash coming in incredibly fast and close thus forcing you to look down and track at that same speed for most this can prove to be very difficult in practice because you are going to have to drastically increase your average tracking speed just to keep up this is why we are warming up this aspect of centering so that when the time comes you not left flustered and moving sporadically but rather making shots like this because you already used to the rate at which the target is moving now let's move on to our first scenario and piggy back off this warm-up I want you to keep centering the targets and only fire when you were at extremely close ranges and not before constantly moving and being as evasive as possible eliminating 10 targets before moving on the next scenario we'll be moving on to will be mid-range tracking where we will use counter strafing or mirroring on the first moving Target while maintaining centering while reloading and even in between shots this will break the habit of moving the reticle away from the target after each shot essentially flicking as well as minimize the amount of micro adjustments needed before taking the next shot another thing to note is that mirroring makes it a lot easier to hit shots with the 1887 however it makes you an easier Target as well so just keep that in mind when you get into engagements eliminate 10 targets with two to three shots before moving on that is not achieved I want you to reload and start again the next and final scenario for this weapon is quite important although this may seem like a Target switching scenario I want you to consider it as a Target acquisition and click timing scenario like I said before accuracy is essential for this weapon if you are able to acquire and hit the target first the likelihood that you will win the engagement increases drastically because of the amount of burst damage this shotgun can do so what I want you to do is spend 5 minutes shooting the first moving Target then acquiring either one of the light targets to the left or the heavy Target to the right shooting one of them and then transitioning back to the first moving Target please prioritize smoothness and accuracy over everything else in this exercise if you trust the process I promise you the speed will come and that just about wraps things up I hope you guys enjoyed this video as much as I enjoyed making it I'll be honest with you at first taking up this weapon felt like a daunting task But as time went on this slowly became one of my favorite and most satisfying weapons to use if you found this video informative please don't forget to smash that like button it really really helps

However, they have found a workaround by canceling the animation which allows them to fire the last needed shot. They also mention a difficulty with tracking fast opponents at close ranges, especially those using high damage weapons. They suggest that being efficient in tracking can make the game easier and separates a good player from a great one. 

They also discuss the importance of matching play style with different maps. Some maps favor close-range weapons, while others with long corridors or open spaces may not provide many opportunities for close-range combat. They advise the need for patience and mobility in these situations. They have observed players making reckless moves, disregarding their cover and getting eliminated as a result. They advise that in these situations, it's better to retreat, reposition, and use cover as much as possible.

The user also praises the effectiveness of the 1887 shotgun, especially when used with a competent team that can provide shielding, distraction, and cover fire. They enjoy the flexibility of mixing and matching abilities to create a loadout that suits their play style.

However, they note that the game punishes inaccuracies severely, emphasizing that the shotgun, with only six bullets, requires precision to be effective. They also recommend utilizing hip fire during the training routine because it doesn't receive any inaccuracy penalties and allows for faster movement and increased awareness.

Overall, the user seems to enjoy the current state of the game, appreciating the strategic elements, the variety of weapons and abilities, and the game's focus on skill and precision. The user seems to have a positive opinion about the weapon system in the game, especially in terms of skill-based mechanics, where accuracy and smoothness are prioritized over speed.

The user suggests that the shotgun may be less effective in close-range engagements against fast and agile targets, which could be seen as a weakness in weapon balancing.

In terms of the game's current state, the user doesn't provide a detailed opinion.

They believe that mastering the tracking speed and centering targets are crucial for effectively using this weapon.

However, the user's opinion on the overall state of the game is not explicitly mentioned in the text. The focus is more on the weapon balancing and specific strategies for using the shotgun effectively. The detailed opinion about weapon balancing in this game seems to be positive. The user initially found using the weapon to be a daunting task, implying it may have felt difficult or unbalanced.

The Finals Medium Class guide,1W68_0qqy6Q,ULTIMATE Beginner&#39;s Guide to Medium Class The Finals From a Top 500 Player In 2023,hello everyone my name is Chris in this video I'm going to share the easiest yet most effective way to play medium and dominate your ranked tournaments in the first part of this guide we will talk about best competitions to run with your friends and I think there are two most optimal ones you either run medium medium heavy or light medium heavy let's dive deep into each one of them because the play styles are going to be drastically different when we talk about the role of the medium in a double medium heavy composition it's very important to fundamentally understand uh possibilities and limitations of your setup first of all let's talk about the positive sides of the composition you have insane sustain your tank can go from 0 HP to 100 in a span of 2 seconds while being completely safe behind the bubble and a shield if your team dies and you are the last medium alive and your second medium has the defibrillator ready you can defib him he can defib heavy and then you can go for the reset and after 3 seconds all of you are going to be semi ready to start the fight again medium medium heavy composition is really easy to run because you are pretty much holding hands together you have everything you need within each other and there is no need to micromanage the light that's running on the site you don't need to 3 to one it that much because at the end of the day you just follow the heavy and he does all the work while you are keeping him alive and enabling him with movement I feel like the biggest problem with double medium heavy composition is that it's very weak against glitch grenades it's very weak if you are not holding hands together a talented light player is going to pick off a medium on your team with ease every single time with a stun maybe he's running a shotgun and he's just going to to pump you up close and you would have to waste your time waste your resources to go back defe them waste the bubble and the resources that you are willing to put offensively are going to be used defensively just to reset and fix the mistake of your teammate when it comes to the light medium heavy composition this is whole another story first of all if you don't have a very talented extraordinary light player on your team I highly advise you to never run this composition because this is just going to be a complete throw very difficult to use very difficult to communicate with very difficult to 3 to one you need to have a perfect engage time you need to be really careful because the downtime on you dying on medium is going to be like detrimental if you die on medium you don't have the ability to instar Res you don't have the ability to sustain and then you are playing a 2 plus one composition where like the light has to set up the light has to three to one his glitch grenade and then you maybe use your RPG and then you jump out on top of the players it's very difficult to use and it might be higher skill ceiling but at the end of day it's going to be a lot harder to make it work when it comes to the best medium build you can possibly go for you need to look at the healing beam I highly advise you to go for it because Guardian turret and Recon sensus are kind of a throw in the sense that you really want to keep your heavy and the third player alive for as long as you possibly can because at the end of the day it's not about you killing other players it's about you securing the cash out and the longer your heavy stays alive the longer you will be able to stall the point when it comes to the weapon of choice I really think that you only have the ability to use SCAR or an akm outside of that these weapons don't provide any real value first of all they are either not versatile or they lack range or they are just too difficult and inconsistent to use and pretty much all of them has all the three reasons combined which makes them very bad weapon choices when it comes to difference between Scar and an akm akm is a lot more forgiving when it comes to your aim you can miss bullets and still be absolutely fine due to the 36 mag size but you have slower time to kill it means that it will take you more time to kill a person when we compare it with a scar you have faster time to kill but only 20 bullets in a magazine so you would want to ideally shoot your weapon until you need to reload and if your teammates are low switch to the healing beam to help them because at the end of the day you have Windows of opportunities in this game I understand that if you are not uh an extraordinary player yet you don't see the game like that but again you need to look at your cooldowns your teammates cooldowns your enemy cooldowns your enemy's magazine size and the time when they will reload and all of that matters a lot so if you shoot your weapon and then you reload your heavy might die because there is an opportunity for enemies to kill him but when you use your healing beam you keep him alive maybe he's resetting his bubble maybe he's resetting his RPG depending on the situation and you will have better chances of winning the game when it comes to other gadgets I highly advise you to go for double movement if you are a main healer so you go for zip line and you go for the jump pad because at the end of the day you want to third party as much as you possibly can you want to take best positions as much as possible you want to grab The High Ground when you can grab the high ground and you cannot do that without the zip line and the jump pad if you are the flex healer you can actually swap the zip line or a jump pad for the aps turret this is going to be very important when it comes to you holding hands and holding uh roofs because at the end of the day APS turret is going to block all the RPGs all the bubbles it's going to make sure that you are staying alive and healthy and nothing is killing you when you are holding an advantageous spot and when it comes to the last Gadget defibrillator has to be the must because at the end of the day like the fast res is so freaking overpowered you res your medium your medium reses your heavy and then again you are ready to go and now let me explain everything you need to know about protecting the cash out and stealing the cash out from other players mistake number one I see see every single new player in the finals is doing is that they are rushing to steal the cash out it's very important to understand the timings and instead of going in and being third partied and fourth parted and this this mechanic also exists in the game you can actually wait for other players to fight and then you collect all the benefits by three to oneing with your team and working together instead of running around like chickens without head so first thing you need to do is you see that a cash out is not yours you need to set up on a high ground and collect three kills very important to do so you have a jump pad you have a zip line enable your heavy so three of you can actually look at the same Target your heavy has the barrel with a C4 and you have an akm or a scar to finish off the lights and mediums that are running around like ch chickens without head and then again you have all the time in the world it takes about I don't know how many seconds but you can wait until the very end and then while everyone is weak out of cooldowns out of ammo you can three to one with bubble drop on a Target drop on a point and actually steal it your heavy can Shield you with his Q your heavy can Shield you with his bubble you can actually use your light as a protection with his stun gun and overall this will drastically improve your play style when it comes to defending the cash out it's pretty much the same you can give it up you can let it go and play the steel strategy or you can defend it and there are fundamental principles that you need to follow in order to be good at this game take The High Ground And if you are running medium medium heavy you will have the ability to place an APS turret you will have the ability to sit in a corner with a shi shield and almost be invulnerable make sure that you abuse the windows of opportunities where enemies are bursting down the shield and they have to reload this is going to be the perfect time to strike make sure that if enemies are throwing the bubble at you you constantly break it and then when you are out of ammo you just protect your team with a healing beam and reset just to use the window of opportunity to strike again when it comes to your jump pad usage use your um slide before you jump jump to jump further when it comes to another ways to use your movement is at the end of the zip line you can actually go for the Bunny Hop movement kind of play style where you are jumping off of it and then you jump for a few more times to prolong your movement and gain additional velocity the same goes for the jump pad if you place it on the side of the roof you can actually gain additional momentum just don't forget to slide before you approach the jump pad thank you very much for watching this guide if you found it useful leave me a like on this video subscribe to the channel check out my twitch Channel I feel like I'm going to stream soon if you have any questions or suggestions let me know in the comment section see you in the next one take care,"The player, Chris, offers detailed opinions about weapon balancing and overall user opinions on the current state of the game. 

He suggests that the most effective strategy in ranked tournaments involves using medium-heavy compositions, such as double medium-heavy or light-medium-heavy. These compositions offer excellent sustainability, and the ability to recover quickly from a team wipe, due to the second medium's defibrillator ability. 

However, Chris also identifies some weaknesses. For instance, the double medium-heavy composition is particularly vulnerable to glitch grenades and talented light players. More specifically, if the team is not sticking together, a skilled light player can easily eliminate a medium player. This would result in a waste of time and resources, as the team would need to resurrect the defeated medium and use their protective bubble ability. 

Thus, he suggests that the game could benefit from some balancing adjustments to address these vulnerabilities. Despite these slight issues, Chris appears to enjoy the game and appreciates the strategic depth offered by different team compositions. The user's opinion on weapon balancing seems to be critical. They mention that the light-medium-heavy composition of the game is difficult to use unless there is a highly skilled light player involved. They think that the downtime when dying on medium is too detrimental, and they believe that weapons outside of the SCAR and the AKM do not provide any real value due to lack of versatility, range, and consistency. 

Regarding the overall state of the game, the user seems to feel that it is difficult and requires a high level of skill, particularly with the 3-to-1 engagement time and the need for perfect timing. They also advise against certain builds, such as Guardian turret and Recon sensus, and suggest using the healing beam to keep the heavy and third player alive longer. The user also emphasizes the importance of securing the cash out and stalling the point, rather than killing other players. 

In conclusion, the user seems to find the game challenging due to its weapon balancing, and they believe that certain strategies and weapons are more effective than others. Opinions on Weapon Balancing:
1. The player believes that there's an acceptable balance between weapons with large magazine size but slower time-to-kill (TTK), and weapons with faster TTK but smaller magazine size. 
2. They note that using a weapon with a larger magazine size allows for more missed shots while still being able to engage in combat effectively. 
3. They add that managing weapon reload times and magazine sizes in relation to the enemy's actions is a key strategy, suggesting that the balancing of these elements is crucial to gameplay.

Overall User Opinions on the Current State of the Game:
1. The user appreciates the strategic depth of the game, emphasizing the importance of managing cooldowns, teammates' statuses, and enemies' actions.
2. They advise using mobility gadgets like zip line and jump pad for main healers to facilitate third-party engagements and positioning, implying that these elements add to the game's strategic complexity and enjoyment.
3. Flex healers are recommended to consider using the APS turret for defense, highlighting the game's allowance for varied playstyles.
4. They appreciate the necessity of the defibrillator gadget, suggesting that it adds to the game's tactical layer.
5. The user seems to appreciate the game's focus on strategy and teamwork, with different roles (like main healer and flex healer) having different optimal strategies and equipment.
6. They seem to indicate that the game is in a good state balance-wise, with various strategies, roles, and The user seems to have mixed opinions about the game. They express frustration about the weapon balance, particularly the fast res (fast resurrection) ability, which they deem as overpowered. This mechanism allows a player to resurrect their medium, who then resurrects their heavy and the whole team is ready for combat again. 

However, the user also appreciates the strategic aspect of the game. They discuss the importance of understanding timing and avoiding rushing into stealing the cash out, which is a common mistake they see new players making. Instead, they suggest waiting for other players to fight, and then collecting the benefits by working together as a team. 

They further explain the importance of using the high ground advantage and making use of the weapons and abilities each team member has. For instance, the heavy's barrel with a C4, lights and mediums with an AKM or a Scar. Utilizing these properly can drastically improve the player's style and performance. 

When it comes to defending the cash out, the user suggests either giving it up and playing the steal strategy, or defending it by following some fundamental principles, such as taking the high ground. They also mention the utility of running a medium-medium-heavy setup, which provides opportunities for strategic plays.

Overall, the user seems to find the game engaging due to its emphasis on strategy and teamwork, but they have concerns about certain aspects such as weapon balance. The text does not provide explicit opinions on weapon balancing or the current state of the game. However, it offers strategies, such as using the shield for protection during enemy attacks and timing attacks when enemies are reloading. It also provides advice on using the jump pad and zip line for enhanced movement and velocity. The user suggests taking advantage of windows of opportunity to strike and using the healing beam to protect the team. The guide appears to be appreciated by the user, as they are asking for likes and subscriptions, hinting at a positive opinion on the game's mechanics."
The Finals Medium Class guide,UmeJcrWX2Y8,THE FINALS 50 Tips EVERY Medium Player MUST Know (Beginner To Pro),here are some useful medium tips that you need to know there is a cool trick with a red Barrel where you can left click it press F to get it back to your hand and instead of it being random and flying all over the place you can actually control the place where you want the barrel to be exploded at the red Barrel trick will not work with the gas Barrel as you would want to manually activate it by meleeing it a few times before you throw it and it's going to explode on impact and interesting thing about gas grenade is that opponents will not take any damage while they are hiding behind the wall but when you go for a gas mine you can clearly see that you can damage yourself your teammates and enemies through walls floors and ceilings you can use this trick to prevent enemies from stealing the cash out if you are playing below you also need to know that gas can be countered by flames whether it's going to be a flamethrower flammable Barrel or a pyro grenade so knowing that information you really don't want to place gas barrels and flammable barrels on your cash out as they will actually grief each other be mindful about your defibrillator usage use it in emergency situations only if you have the chance especially if you are playing Recon to take your teammate somewhere safe and slowly res him so he can be full HP and ready to fight do this instead I personally think that double movement which is zip line Plus Jump pad on your medium is super ior to any other combination as you have the option to off angle allow your Heavies to quickly get on high grounds and quickly rotate through the map and especially if you are going for an aggressive play style you want to be on other side of the map as fast as possible multiple times throughout the match if you get stunned By the Light player from behind Don't Panic just kill him it's that simple you can perform an interesting ankle breaker by going behind the cover to then quickly slide out of it surprise your enemies and make it very uncomfortable for them to kill you try to always slide before using the jump pad it will give you additional distance when you are playing scar try to always aim at the upper chest area of a person this way you will be as accurate as possible while still occasionally going for head shot if I need to reload midf fight I usually go for a combination of sliding to the left and then quickly jumping to the right it makes it a lot harder for my enemies to track my model both Scar and akm are extremely accurate up close without ads just press left click and focus on strafing as a medium player you should always prioritize your life over anything else if you see that there is no way for you to win the team fight instead of fully committing and dying as a team you maybe want to see relax and wait for your teammates to coin or wait for enemies to leave so you can res your teammates after as the match starts try to always cycle your movement cooldowns in order to get a superior position over your enemies for example that guy was completely clueless and out of position don't forget to use the window climb method to surprise your enemies from an unexpected angle as a medium player it is always your responsibility to steal the cash out ask your heavy player for a bubble mesh shield and a body block to be safe when you see that enemies are going for the last second steal instead of trying to bra them as they come in close let them come close and when they going to steal run forward and head shot the guy as a medium player you absolutely need to have good aim and you can have it if you spend 10 to 15 minutes every day just shooting bots in a practice range go for 360s explore and feel your sensitivity and with time you will see that you have better tracking better clicking and overall your aim will improve drastically when you're starting the fight make sure that your Crosshair is on the target before you press your left click this will increase your accuracy and opponents will have less time to react and they will die faster you can also take less damage if you go for unpredictable strafe patterns if you see an isolated Target on a high ground you can always go for the 3 to1 jump out with your team to surprise an enemy and quickly finish fin him off if you have good aim Recon is far better than a healing beam as it will allow you to set up for future fights always see where enemies are and kill solo players you can place your jump pad on the wall to surprise your enemies with unexpected movement don't forget to slide while looking into it and perform a small bunny hop in hand for maximum efficiency you can place the jump pad on the side of the door in order to always see when enemies are approaching you because they would have to shoot it Additionally you can place your jump pad at the start of the door in order to make it difficult for opponents to enter it without breaking the jump pad it's very useful when you are being chased there are situations where you would absolutely want to destroy the jump pad after you have used it yourself you can kill a person if you throw something at him and he's below 50 HP when you're out of ammo make sure that you always perform full reload animation before you start climbing or doing anything else as it will cancel the full reload and you will have to start all over again if you throw goo on your guardian turret and then pick it up the goo will explode if your guardian turret is damaged you can always pick it with your hand and then place it again and it will be full HP when riding a horizontal zip line you can jump to make it difficult for enemies to hit you it's easier to control your recoil while spraying if you are anti-ir in the opponent's movement if he goes left you go right it's called aim smoothing you can check it on YouTube you can see enemies better with Recon sensus if you inspect your zip line or a jump pad when going for a vertical zip line you can always go for a little super jump right at the end of your zip line to give yourself additional momentum plus ability to choose the direction in which you will fall we already know that there is a window climbing technique that allows you to access High Ground rounds faster but you can also perform the same trick on certain rooftops for example Skyway Stadium uh lower buildings and then buildings on Monaco some of them are accessible when it comes to the rooftops when you are jumping from the window there is still a bug in the game where if you place a guardian turret on top of the goo Barrel start the mantling animation and pick it up it will send you flying you can also place an APS turret on top of the goo Barrel in order to throw it and completely destroy all the mines and C4s on the cash out that you are trying to steal you should definitely try the tracking Dart in your games as it will give you Superior information on enemies that you were able to hit it with you can drastically change your direction midair whether it's going to be a Mega Jump pad a small jump pad or a zip line everyone knows that you can break zip lines but did you know that you can break ladders in this game if you have good aim and you are playing Recon sensus I highly advise you to go for the scar play style where you can off angle when you can try to find one versus one Duos but when you're playing with a healing beam or you are not as good with your aim go for an AK this weapon will forgive the mistakes that you are making this weapon will allow you to poke enemies and shoot enemy Shields this is exactly what you're going to do if you'll play behind your heavy when you're playing with a healing beam it's very important to hold hands with your heavy player you will enable him with movement he will enable you with protection and point presence if you run away from your heavy he won't be able to save you with his bubble and mesh shield and you won't be able to keep him alive with your healing beam and poke damage with an AK you can slide off from the edge of anything to give yourself an additional momentum boost do this to travel longer distances go for a jump before the end of the zip line to give yourself additional momentum and ability to do a small Bunny Hop when going for the reson your teammate with defibrillator make sure that there is nothing blocking your line of sight whether it's a bush or a small plant that was it for today see you next time,"The user seems to have detailed knowledge about various weapons and tricks within the game. They mention an exploit with the red barrel that allows for more controlled explosions, but point out that it doesn't work with the gas barrel, which needs to be manually activated and has different damage mechanics. They express that gas grenades are ineffective against opponents behind walls, but a gas mine can damage through barriers, which can be used strategically. They also caution against placing gas barrels and flammable barrels near each other as they can interfere with each other. 

The user advises careful use of the defibrillator, suggesting it should be used in emergencies and safely if possible. They strongly favor the combination of the zip line and jump pad for movement, as it allows for quick rotations and high ground advantage, especially for aggressive plays. They also mention an effective technique when stunned by a light player, advising not to panic and just to counter-attack. They propose an interesting maneuver to surprise enemies by quickly sliding out from behind cover.

Overall, the user seems to be quite satisfied with the current state of the game. They appear to appreciate the strategic depth and variety of the game mechanics, as well as the balance between different weapons and tools.

The user also appreciates the variety of build styles the game offers, such as melee and heavy builds. 

In terms of the overall state of the game, they seem to be content, especially with the level of creativity and detail in the game's cosmetic items. They express that the quality of these items makes the cost of the game's battle pass and cosmetics seem worthwhile."
The Finals best weapons,fiB8Ss0L4tU,The BEST Loadout for EVERY BUILD in The Finals 2024,after playing the finals almost every day since his release and trying out everything the game has to offer I believe I have found the best loadouts for every build in the final of course this isn't set in stone as everybody plays a little bit different these will be some important pointers to help build your own contestants that suit your play style drop a like And subscribe if you enjoy the video and without wasting any time heading straight into the light build for specializations the best pick has to be the cloaking device you go invisible and in the finals it's actually very hard to see cloaked players then if you take a look at all the weapons the light class has to offer they're almost all back best used in close range battles having the cloaking device as your specialization allows you to get up really close up to the enemies without them seeing you and getting close with these weapons helps you put out a lot more damage I also love the cloaking device for scouting enemies for your team as before pushing a team you want to know where they are positioned so you can put yourself in the best spot possible the cloaking device allows you to investigate your enemies without them seeing you and then if you are a team player you can relay this information to your teammate then the other specialization I would recommend is the evasive Dash now for 95% of the player base I would say just stick with the cloaking device but if you have exceptional movement and solid aim to back it up then the evasive Dash might be a good pick for you but the key is you have to have some high level movement otherwise your 150 Health points will get drained very quickly the idea is that you want to be dashing back and forth so enemies blow through all their ammo trying to shoot you then you can easily take them out when they're stuck reloading the other benefit to the evasive Dash similar to the cloaking device is that allows you to get up close to your enemy to deal burst damage you can quickly Dash right up to your enemy with a shotgun a melee weapon or an SMG and quickly eliminate them before they realize what happened but this is where good aim is essential if you miss these important shots after dashing into an enemy it will most likely turn you into a trophy especially with heavy players being as strong as they are one well-placed RPG rocket can take you out if you aren't being careful now the grappling hook does have some utility and having the ability to quickly Dash by using the grapple hop trick is nice but it just isn't as beneficial as the other specializations and honestly at this point if you're choosing the grappling hook just switch to medium and use a jump pad you will have 100 more health Health points and you can use literal wall hacks on top of it then for your weapon the go-to for most players in high ranks is the XP 54 it is a super easy to use SMG as The Recoil pattern is straight up to the right and it has a scope on it making it much easier to land your shot now the other SMG option that you could use is the M11 in theory this weapon is very good as it can deal a lot of damage fast and it has 10 more bullets in a clip than the xp54 and its reload speed is much faster but it is simply way harder to use first off it has less range she have to get up really close to your enemy then the iron sights and the shake makes it really hard to see where you're shooting at and The Recoil pattern Zips back and forth making it difficult to control so if you do want to use an SMG just stick with the xp54 then the other weapon I would recommend for the Le class is the sh1 1900 the double barrel shotgun you can twap any player in the game including heavy and in combination with a cloaking device or evasive Dash you can get up right next to your enemies and basically insta kill them the one thing you do have to keep in mind is that as soon as you shoot your two shots you need to get out of there as soon as possible possible and change position if you stick around just a little bit too long you will be an easy elimination now the other weapons are certainly fun to use but they have no meaningful place in a competitive setting right now for the gadgets one that I highly suggest using is the glitch grenade one of the most OP things in the game right now are Shields and heals one glitch grenade is able to completely deny the other team's abilities making them sitting ducks for your teammates to capitalize on I also recommend using the stun gun as it makes whoever you stun an easy target as they can barely move can't interact with anything can't use abilities in the can even aim down sight now for the last Gadget I would either suggest running a breach charge you can destroy walls and create new openings to use gas grenades to block off an area of the map and make it difficult for the enemies to steal the cashio or I would use the pyrro grenade as it takes away gas and the gas grenades are a huge counter to the light build to being able to take it away with a power grenades is a huge plus now onto the medium build for specializations the best pick hands down is the healing gun it allows you to keep your team alive and in combination with the shields from the heavy class it is very hard for enemies to eliminate you it also Al cancels out gas damage so if you are healing your teammates they can still steal a cash out that is covered in gas now the other best specialization is Recon sensus it is literally wall hack and as long as there isn't fog you can see the enemies across the entire map Recon sensus allows you to get a lot of free and easy eliminations as you can always pre- aim wherever the enemies are going to be and if you communicate with your team Recon sensus is incredibly strong as you can see where each team is going so you know exactly which cash out to steal or which Vault you should be going to then whenever a team respawns you can quickly activate Recon senses to see which direction they are so your team can set up accordingly for weapons there's only really two options I would focus on the akm and the F car if you look at the F car it has an easy recoil pattern to master and good optic to see where you're shooting it also deals a ton of damage but of course it has a very small magazine you only have 20 bullets before you have to reload so if you are confident in your aim and can hit consistent head shot the F car is really good otherwise I would suggest the akm the akm has a MAG size of 30 36 almost double that of the F car The Recoil and the iron sights are certainly harder to use than the F car with a few minutes in the practice range you shouldn't have any real trouble with it now one of the big benefits of running the akm over the F car is the damage you can do to Shields you can quickly dump one mag into a heavy player's mes shield and completely destroy it then as you're reloading your team can deal the followup damage for you or if you have two akms on your team there's a ton of Firepower the enemies have to walk into so both assault rifles are great you should try them both out to see which works better for your play style for gadgets there is a clear meta always be using the defibrillator having the capability to revive a teammate in the heat of a battle is so incredibly strong and if you aren't already using it you need to start using it now now do keep in mind the defib provides enemies with around half of their Total Health I believe it is 40% so if you have a heal beam you should be using it on them right away the other Gadget I would use 100% of the time is the jump pad allows you to quickly get up to High Ground when necessary then if you put it on an angle you can quickly bounce towards or away from enemies also you can't forget that heavy players don't have much Mobility at all so you need to be using the jump pad had to help enable them to get around the map you can also place a jump pad right under cash out to make it bounce and enemies will have a very hard time stealing it there are just so many uses for the jump pad so I recommend always having it in your load out then for the last Gadget you have a few different options depending on your play style an easy pick is the explosive mind you can place some on the cash out in doorways or on the enemy trophies to deny the revive then there is also the aps turet that can help you defend an objective by destroying any incoming projectiles there's also the zip line that allows you to gather around the map quickly then the gadget that I run most often is the gas grenade allows me to force enemies out of a position and you have more control over the gas grenades than you do with the gas mine the gas also goes through walls and Floors making it very hard for enemies to see it coming and it gives you hit markers whenever you're dealing damage to an enemy which helps give you a rough idea of where they're plan then we have the heavy build for the specialization most of the time you should be using the mes Shield blocks incoming damage if with medium players behind you the enemies will have a lot of difficulty trying to take you out the goo gun and the charging slam both have their moments but the mes Shield is almost always a better pick for the weapons you have two options that are very powerful firstly there is the sa 1216 an automatic shotgun that I believe has the highest damage per second of any weapon in the game Heavy with an auto shoty in close-range fights is almost impossible to out gun then when you also have a medium player healing him at the same time he is even stronger when you use the shotgun with the mes Shield allows you to deny damage from range but then when they get up close they get deleted by the high DPS the other great pick is the ls gun it has consistent damage with an easy to control recoil pattern then it also has a MAG size of 40 s you can keep shooting for quite a while you can never go wrong defaulting to the ls gun when you aren't sure what you should be using the first Gadget I always recommend using as a heavy player is the RPG it's a good way to get some quick damage on your enemies and it is the perfect counter to any light players running around the next Gadget I always use is the C4 that's because it allows you to do the most overpowered trick in the game by attaching the C4s to explosives then throwing and exploding them in enemy faces it will literally one shot Heavies if it is close enough I believe it does around 4 to 500 damage if plac perfectly and considering heavy players have 350 Health it is a lot of damage hopefully this Tech will be Nerf soon but as of now it is extremely strong and you should be abusing it to win your game the other Gadget I always use is the Dome Shield it allows you and your team to shoot through it however the enemies can't shoot through it it's perfect for clutching up a few kills without taking damage or to force enemies to get up close to you and then when the closer you can either use your shotgun your Sledgehammer or an RPG to quickly eliminate them it might seem a bit overkilled to run the mes Shield and the Dome Shield at the same time but Overkill is exactly what you want Overkill is what makes it so difficult for enemies to defeat you now you need to be using these loadouts if you want to be winning consistently but there is a lot more to the game which is why you need to watch this video up on your screen now thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video,"The user's opinions on weapon balancing seem to be largely positive, indicating that the best loadouts can be found for every build in the game. They believe that the light class weapons are best used in close range battles, suggesting that the game's weapon balancing is effective in providing different tactical options. They also appreciate the cloaking device for scouting enemies, highlighting a strategic depth in the game's mechanics.

The user also recommends the evasive dash for players with exceptional movement and solid aim. However, they acknowledge that this can be risky as players can quickly lose health if not used correctly, suggesting that there may be some balance issues with this tactic.

Their overall user opinions on the current state of the game appear to be positive. They seem to enjoy the variety of strategies available, and they praise the game for its strategic depth and the effectiveness of different tactical options. They appreciate the ability to build contestants that suit their play style, indicating satisfaction with the game's customization options. Weapon Balancing Opinions:
1. The player appreciates the quick elimination capabilities of shotguns and SMGs, however, good aim is crucial for these weapons to be effective.
2. The player feels heavy players are currently too strong, especially with their ability to eliminate others with a single RPG rocket.
3. The grappling hook is seen as having utility but is not as beneficial as other specializations. The player suggests switching to medium and using a jump pad instead.
4. The XP 54 is popular among high-rank players due to its ease of use and scope. The recoil pattern is manageable and simplifies landing shots.
5. The M11 is seen as a good weapon in theory due to its high damage and extra bullets. However, its close-range requirement, iron sights, shaking, and difficult recoil pattern make it hard to use.
6. The SH1 1900 double-barrel shotgun is recommended for its ability to eliminate any player, especially when used with a cloaking device or evasive dash. The need to change position quickly after shooting is emphasized.

Overall User Opinions on the Current State of the Game:
1. The game currently requires a good aim to effectively use some weapons.
2. The strength of heavy players is viewed as an issue.
3. The grappling hook is not as beneficial as other specializations, suggesting certain game mechanics could be improved.
4. Some weapons like the XP 54 and SH1 1900 are appreciated for their strengths and The user believes that the game's weapon balancing needs improvement, as many weapons have no significant role in the competitive scene. They express that the glitch grenade is overpowered and highly recommended, due to its ability to neutralize opponents' abilities. The stun gun is also favored as it immobilizes opponents, making them easy targets. The user also suggests using either the breach charge for creating new paths or the pyrro grenade to counteract gas grenades.

In terms of overall user opinions on the game's current state, they find shields and heals to be excessively strong. The healing gun is highly praised for its ability to sustain team members, especially when combined with the shields from the heavy class. The user also appreciates the Recon sensus for its ability to locate enemies across the map, which they find particularly useful for planning strategies and securing eliminations.

Despite the favorable view on some aspects, the user's opinion suggests that the game might benefit from further balancing to ensure all weapons and gadgets have meaningful roles in competitive play. This player believes that the weapon balancing between the AKM and the F Car is fairly balanced, but each weapon has its own strengths and weaknesses. The F Car is praised for its easy-to-master recoil pattern, good optic, and high damage, but criticized for its small magazine size. The AKM, on the other hand, is lauded for its larger magazine size and high damage to shields, but its recoil and iron sights are considered more difficult to handle.

The player also comments on the meta of the game, emphasizing the importance of using the defibrillator gadget for its ability to revive teammates during battles. However, it's noted that the revived teammate only receives around 40% of their total health, so the heal beam should be used immediately afterward.

The jump pad is another gadget that the player recommends using all the time. It allows for quick movement to high ground and can be used strategically to bounce towards or away from enemies. It's especially useful to compensate for the limited mobility of heavy players.

The player seems to have a positive overall opinion on the current state of the game, highlighting the strategic aspects, the importance of teamwork, and the versatility of different weapons and gadgets. However, they suggest that players should try out different strategies to see what works best for their play style. The user's opinion about weapon balancing in the game is positive. They mention a variety of weapons and gadgets, highlighting their different uses and effectiveness based on player's style and strategy. They recommend always having the jump pad in the load-out due to its versatility. The explosive mind and the aps turret are also mentioned as good options depending on the situation. The gas grenade is particularly recommended for its ability to force enemies out of a position and provide more control.

The user also appreciates the heavy build specialization, specifically mentioning the mes Shield, which is seen as a reliable choice due to its ability to block incoming damage. The goo gun and the charging slam are also mentioned as having their moments but are generally seen as less effective.

Two weapons are highlighted as powerful options, the sa 1216, an automatic shotgun noted for having the highest damage per second, and the ls gun, which is praised for its consistent damage and easy to control recoil pattern. The sa 1216 combined with the mes Shield is seen as a particularly strong combination, and the ls gun is considered a reliable default choice.

Overall, the user seems to view the current state of the game positively, appreciating the variety of options and strategies available to players. They do not mention any significant issues or imbalances with the weapons or game mechanics. Opinions on Weapon Balancing:
1. The user recommends the use of RPG as it provides a good counter against light players and allows for quick damage.
2. The C4 gadget is considered overpowered due to its ability to one-shot heavy players when used with a particular trick, suggesting possible imbalance. This trick involves attaching C4s to explosives and throwing them at enemies, causing massive damage. The user hopes this trick will be nerfed soon.
3. The Dome Shield is highly valued as it provides an advantage by allowing only the user and their team to shoot through it. This shield is also useful in forcing enemies into close combat.
4. The user suggests that using the Dome Shield in combination with other weapons might seem 'overkill', but this level of power is what makes it hard for enemies to win, implying a favorable balance for those who utilize it.

Overall User Opinions on the Current State of the Game:
1. The user believes that the game is in a state where certain gadgets and tricks can be 'abused' for consistent wins, suggesting a need for rebalancing.
2. The user finds the game engaging and complex, with a lot to learn and master.
3. The user appreciates the strategic elements in the game, such as using specific loadouts and tactics to gain an advantage.
4. Despite potential imbalances, the user seems to enjoy the game and encourages others to continue playing and learning more about it."
The Finals best weapons,2yeLtejNKr0,The BEST and WORST Weapons in The Finals Season 4,here are the best and the worst weapons in the finals season 4 while I was I dropped my mouse where did it go while I Was preparing for the challenge stream that I had with fixie and dank D I figured that it was time to post a new tier list as well and of course as usual huge thanks to Embark for sponsoring this video if you guys want to check out season 4 links in the description let's dive into it starting off with light and the F tier we of course have to talk about the bow now I don't like the bow I know it was buff this season but I have a bone to pick with this thing I think it's just too inconsistent seeing it is a projectile weapon you still need to draw it and it's just not reliable enough when you compare to other weapons in this tier therefore again we're going to put the recurve bow and the F tier but I can definitely see people doing better with it and getting some value out of it if they want to play really flashy heading on into the E tier we going to start it off with the 93 R I know it was buffed this season and honestly yeah you can really feel it it definitely feels better than season 3 or even season 2 but it does still not really pack that much of a punch it is a burst weapon so maybe if you play around corners you can see some value but overall I feel like it just does not help me as a light I want to be able to go in and deal a lot of damage and get a kill and then get out rather than you know slowly plinking enemies down because if I keep plinking enemies down he's going to kill me eventually without me actually killing them so overall even though it was buffed it's easier to use now the sights feel a little bit better and of course the spread is better it just doesn't really hit home just yet which is why again I keep it into etier I never weapon into etier will remain there for the same reason maybe I am rating it too low but I kind of feel like it belongs here and that's the new weapon for a light and it's probably the only new weapon this season that I rate lowly and and of course it's going to be the M26 matter which is a decent gun in theory it can definitely put out a lot of damage however it's more of a sustained damage type of Deal or again you know darting in and out of corners but if you try to all in an enemy and try to get a kill on an enemy let alone a heavy or a medium you're going to die 99% of the time if you have M26 matter whereas if you use any more reliable weapons you probably would get the kill and the thing is that your lack of playing both in the open and one oneing both of the l3r on M26 matter so weapons that take a long time to kill somebody with is obviously bad for light but it's exacerbated by the fact that weapons like SE 40 is really dominating The Meta right now and the SE 40 will out DPS you if you get too close if you TR playing Corners the se40 will just kill you around the corner so you cannot win no matter what you do these guns are just not good enough and it's made even worse by The Meta so again in E tier you have both the 93r M26 matter as for the D tier we're going to started off with the dagger this might be a controversial opinion I know some people say that it's nerfed I guess they might be right it might be a bit slower hitting the alternate fire the back step with the dagger now but you can control it personally after a small adjustment period other than the speed I felt like I got more kills with a dagger now it was just so much easier going for trick stabs just jumping all over the place I just had more control of what I was doing and I believe that most users that weren't Die Hard dagger users probably see this as an overall buff because it is so much easier to actually perform with it it's more consistent sure you can't run and backstab that an entire enemy team in the back in a short span of time which you kind of already couldn't unless you got really lucky so yeah I still think it's pretty solid it just suffers from the same reason that light is suffering the same season and I just cannot rate it any higher than D I'd rather have a weapon in my hand another weapon in the D tier is going to be sh1 1900 which is solid it can one shot a light but again it's not really reliable enough in my opinion maybe it's a skill issue I don't like it you can two shot a medium and get that burst damage if you really try but it's just too much effort without enough of a reward and it's just not consistent enough in my opinion probably because of the screen shake that I want to rate anywhere higher than D so again in the D tier we're going to put the dagger and the sh1 1900 moving on into the C tier we're going to start that tier off with the sword now the sword actually saw some changes and it doesn't look like a lot on paper but once you play with it you can really feel like it feels a lot different the weapon is a lot more accurate now but obviously if you get used to the old accuracy it will take some time adjusting to I didn't manage to do that in time the lunge on your secondary ability has been raised from 5 me to 6 M or so but it feels like an entire Dash you just go flying in One Direction especially seeing as the lunge attack now maintains the top speed for slightly longer so it just feels like you're really flying or dashing forward when you're lunging it feels really good to use the sword and honestly maybe C tier is rating it too low but once you compare to the other weapons higher up in the list it will make sense another weapon in the C tier is going to be the throwing knives which now also saw a buff that you can just hold the right click and let go whenever you want it doesn't make that much of a difference for the throwing knives in my opinion maybe it's because when I was playing the throg knives I just made a habit of spamming right click and then eventually I would hit the enemy when it came around the corner or whatever I didn't really feel like it was a necessary addition it's a quality of lifing it's appreciated but it's still the throwing knives I feel like like you just don't really get to do much with them they deal a decent amount of damage but they're a projectile weapon and seeing as you're trading with heavy or medium again the whole Cal 40 problem or even the pike you're just going to die every single time if you're using the Frog knives they're just not amazing they're middle of the pack C tier is not amazing and closing out to C tier I'm going to put the v9s here I know it's a solid gun I would love to put it higher but I don't think that it has enough damage where it's worth it I know that jel can put a sight on the v9s and it feels really good especially with certain skins as you now can actually see what you're shooting at much more easily it's easier to track the enemy but compared to the other weapons which we'll get to in a little bit it has a semi-auto trigger so you need to keep spam clicking it the hip fire is not very reliable on it and the Damage isn't all that I don't have the updated numbers in front of me but I'm pretty sure it probably deals the same as like an M11 or a pre-nerf xp54 it's not insane it just doesn't make that much of a difference so again in the C tier we're going to place the sword the Frog knives and the be B NS all decent choices just a little bit on the troll side you probably better off using the following weapons instead so starting off the bti we have the lh1 now the lh1 is in a particular place I'm going to keep it in the B tier because it is a solid weapon especially now that you can put a sight on it but it still has gotten a indirect Nerf because of where the meta is heading again seal 40 or whatever or if you get to the longer ranges you're going to be playing as Pike users which we're going to cover in a little bit and you're just going to lose every time because the break point on a pike I believe a medium can kill a light with free shots but it takes I think four or five for a light to kill the medium back with the lh1 and it's just such a big difference in the time to kill that it's just not worth it using the lh1 if you're facing something like a pike which you probably will face all the time again it's definitely a buff maybe can use it as a single fire xp54 variant this season but overall it it works just not my biggest recommendation for light another weapon in the B is going to be the sr84 now this actually saw a Nerf because you now fire projectile shots past 4 met rather than just hit scan all the way but it's still a pretty good gun especially in a longer range meta I could argue that you have a better chance beating a medium with a pike by using a sr84 then you are with an lh1 because you can shoot once s 84 and if it's a heady they're going to have what 10 Health left you can just shoot them in a body or maybe they already were low enough in which case they're just going to die but lh1 exposes you for too long to actually give you proper value if you're trading with a long range fighter but that was that for the B tier again that's the lh1 and the sr84 going into the B tier hopping on into the a tier we have the xp54 which was my previous s tier pick it is a great gun I still think it's a great gun despite seeing a noticeable Nerf to its damage per second it lost two damage per bullet but seeing as it is a high fire rate weapon that makes a very huge dent in its damage per second over the course of a whole clip and you can really feel it when you're trying to fight for example a heavy or in some cases even a medium with good movement and it just doesn't feel the same it's still a solid gun I still felt like I was getting kills with it it's has very reliable and in my opinion pretty easy to control recoil pattern but it doesn't hit as hard so again that puts the XP 4 in the a tier and that brings us to the S tier for a light this season it stands out over the all even xp54 and that is the M11 which technically didn't even get a buff this season unless you count the reticle above which I guess it is so the M11 is the exact same has always been it's been pulling the valves strategy of doing absolutely nothing and having the cover guns just fall over face first and be useless it deals a solid amount of damage as we always have known it has a very good hip fire when it comes to spraying across most Rangers I think up to 5 or 10 m it's very accurate with the addition of the non-world Crosshair setting which makes your Crosshair in the middle of the screen static so it's easier to track an enemy when a lot of things are going around where the voice would jump around in addition to receiving a reticle which lets you aim down sight and actually see what you're shooting at just makes the M11 so good and seeing as xp54 which I believe had a higher DPS than M11 previously doesn't anymore there's really no reason to run anything else in M11 right now so if I would put any weapon in s for light I don't think light is in that of a healthy place at the moment but if I had to put one weapon in the s for light it's a pretty solid weapon and that's going to be the M11 moving on let's talk about medium who is seeing a massive stride to season so starting off going to start off with the F tier of all their weapons and it's really only one weapon here that I have to quickly mention and that is still going to be the dual blades I do not like them I've never liked them and probably never will they're like a riot shield but worse the deflect or the reflect is not reliable you still bleed health over time even if you're constantly holding it up and you're just going to die a lot as a medium using the dual blades it's like a riot shield which was my previous Le favorite weapon but way worse that was it for f tier so let's skip the E tier and we're going to talk about the D tier and of course that's going to be the riot shield again I don't like melee weapons in general I definitely don't like them on medium especially when they deal kind of consistent damage the thing is with the riot shield and even dual blades is that they do offer some protection indicates through the right Shield you have a big Square in front of you that bullets just will not go through whether you hold your Shield up or not it would just possibly do that there are some types of outplays that you can do with a right Shield when you combine it with different gadgets to get more value out of it and it was buffed this season but overall when you compare to actual weapons it's just going to fall short which is why the r Shield stays in a d tier hopping on over into the C tier we have the which received a buff this season you can out put a sight on it however at least in my opinion it is still not hitting as hard as it could or should and now that we have the pike which we will cover soon the Famas kind of doesn't have a place anymore it used to be a maybe mid to long range poking weapon and seeing as we were getting sights added to it a lot of people myself included thought it was poised to be the poking weapon for medium but it's just being power crap there's no reason to run the Famas at the moment which is why I put it in the C tier but popping on into the B tier we have two weapons the first one is a model 1887 I want to place this higher because it is an insanely good weapon in theur and on paper and in a lot of situations but when you're are fighting across the mid to Long ranges it's obviously going to be pretty useless you can pop off if you close a gap and you fight on a point absolutely but if you're fighting teams that is holding a position sitting up on high grounds and you shooting at you with seal 40s or shooting at you with Pikes there's not really much you can do with a model in hand you could make an argument it might belong in the eigh tier but I'm going to keep it in the B tier for now another weapon in the B tier is going to be the cl40 which was buff this season you can definitely feel it it's annoying as hell to fight against especially if you're playing light and in some cases medium because it's very little effort and it will let you get a lot of kills however it still only comes with four shots per magazine it still will be outdps by a lot of weapons in the game and if you have a high ground on a heal for the user they will deal no damage to you it's frustrating to play against it is much easier to use yourself and get maybe a Cheesy killer so so but it's just not reliable enough where I can place it any higher than the B tier so again that put some model and a c 40 in the B tier but moving on we have the a tier and that's going to start off with the akm now as of this season a tiny Nerf it now has 32 bullets instead of 35 you can feel it in some cases I will run into people that run out of ammo when they were one shot away from killing me so if you really use the magazines all the way through consistently it's going to be worse for you to season but you can now attach a sight to it which makes a massive difference and honestly I am more accurate with a sight and I can spare these free bullets as the trade-off is me hitting more than free bullets thanks to having an actual sight you know helping me to actually line up the shots correctly it is a consistent damage weapon pretty easy to control recoil and it just hits really hard another weapon in the a tier is going to be the F car I kind of wanted to move the F car maybe down to the B tier maybe akm would be upper a tier F car would be lower or maybe it's just kind of whichever you prefer because while the akm on paper should be better the F car still feels really good to use it almost feels better than the akm to use I don't know have to wear any undocumented changes or maybe I'm just so used to F card it feels better for me but I actually really like the F card season it hits hard it's consistent it comes with a site so it's up to you what you want to do and of course closing out the we have a weapon that I very much enjoy myself that is the revolver and this one probably benefits the most from a site out of all the weapons in this whole tier list out of in all classes really aiming with the iron sight with revolver used to be really awkward and was probably one of the main reasons that was holding it back from being as good as it could be but thanks to adding a sight to it this season you can now actually again you can see what you're shooting at it's much easier to Blink head shot and just pop off with it it hasn't seen any other Nerfs but this site alone just makes it a lot more relevant than a lot of other weapons it's also a decent weapon if you want to trade back against the medium to maybe even long range depending on how far that long range is so again in the a tier we're going to put the akm the F car and the revolver but then as for the S tier maybe the s+ tier overall if I would compare all the weapons in this game so far this one would take the cake by a long shot but very much intend that some people have disagreed with me on this but I'm going to stand by it and that's that the pike currently is the best gun in the finals and obviously for medium as well the pike hits incredibly hard across really long ranges the damage fall off doesn't seem to exist the scope is a bit awkward to use but it still hits really hard again it three shots are light in the body it's what two shots a medium double head shot and I believe double head shots one body shots are heavy so it shreds across all ranges it's very easy to use the magazine size is fine the only downside with the pike is that sure it has kind of a crappy hip fire and over closer ranges You could argue that it's awkward to use the scope if somebody's really close but all in all if you're accurate with your weapons the Pike's going to be insane it's so good it's maybe not as forgiving as a full auto weapon but again if you're just accurate I cannot see any better weapon this season and it's going to be a must have for me so again the pike goes into the S tier and finally let's talk about heavy starting off with the F tier we're going to have the mgl 32 which was buff this season it's not not enough still terrible Embark is promising a rework to the mgl in the near future or in the future and we're just going to have to wait and see what that entails if I could suggest something as some people who watch My Stream over at twitch.tv/ did ask you know what I would like to see to make it good and honestly if the mgl just exploded on impact with an enemy so it would still need to bounce two times to explode against props or whatever but again against an enemy or a shield instantly explode that would make a massive difference to how good the mgl 32 is because right now it's too consistent and unreliable and I haven't used it I don't know how much different it would be I don't know how the damage would feel but I think on its own that would make a massive difference in just how viable mgl 32 is but anyways that was it for the F tier we put the mg32 moving on into the E tier we have first off the spear which maybe we could have put farther down but it did receive a buff this season I am not a spear enjoyer i' say time and time again I'm not a melee enjoyer but the Run speed modifier during the secondary Spin Attack is now faster so you move a little bit faster as you doing the spin attack can still be decent if you catch enemies off guard or something but at the same time the mesh Shield was nerfed this season it's practically useless especially if you use it with certain types of weapons like melees where you kind of want to weave the shield in and out which to me means that the spear is in a really bad place this time maybe I would put it in the F tier but I feel like I still do better with a spear than I do with the mgl so we're just going to keep it there another weapon in the E tier is going to be the ks trree maybe I'm rating this too low sue me I don't think it's really that good it has some utility with you know it can destroy walls and whatnot but it doesn't really have that much damage it's not really that consistent as it fires a projectile and the Damage even if you do hit every shot doesn't really feel like it's all that maybe if you're just throwing suggestions out today I would love to see if the ks23 could head shot just as a maybe I would love to see what it feels like keep it difficult to use projectile weapon but reward that accuracy with head shots and depending on how impactful that would be it would probably feel like a c or B2 weapon just from that change alone putting it out there just saying so again that puts the spear and K free in the E tier hopping on into the D tier we have the flamethrower which also saw an indirect Nerf dis season because the Chang to mesh Shield which was a very important piece of the flamethrower kit even more so than the spear because weaving The Shield up and down and just kind of dowsing the enemies with a little bit of flames at a time was a valid Strat probably the main Strat for the flamethrower and again it doesn't work so that whole Strat is dead that being said I tried using the gravity Cube that was buff this season with the flamethrower and it felt really good thanks to the much larger range so there is some viability there you can still make it work with some other strats and it deals a decent amount of damage if you use it right definitely better than the spe the K three in my opinion which is why I put it in the D tier heading on into the C tier however we have the Sledge that's a great weapon I love the sledge so much best melee weapon in my opinion you could argue the sword is about the same but the Sledge provides more utility it can one shot you have these one shot Combos and it just has a higher impact especially as you're playing heavy which gives you more utility than I like either way that's just about heavy versus light more than anything but the Sledge just deals a lot of damage and is very reliable assuming you can close the gap so usually would want to run it with a winch claw again M Shield was nerfed less reliable but you can still make it work with the winch or even charge and slam if you feel like it though probably the winch makes more sense another weapon in the C tier that struggled a lot from the mes Shield Nerf and I keep I'm going to keep mentioning the mes Shield because I think that is the most impactful Nerf for heavy season it's going to be the sa26 you can still use the sa1 1216 with say a winch and get some value out of it especially because the animation canel still works but seeing as you no longer have a shield that you can put up and stay behind if you accidentally overextend or you bite off more than you can chew the S6 kind of ends up being an All or Nothing sort of weapon if you take a fight that you shouldn't have there's no getting out of it you're just going to die and be an easy target dead Shield really made a difference in that you can still use the shield and try to escape with it but then you're going to catch you it's not really that good but again closing out the C tier we have Sledge and SFL 16 hopping on into the B tier we have two weapons that honestly feel really good maybe I should even put them higher than this but we'll put them in the BT for now for the first of those two is going to be the luig gun which saw a change to its recoil pattern and it really feels really good now I was surprised to just how much of a difference the Lou gun had it still has that okay first few shots it you know it doesn't have much of a recoil and then it starts picking up much like a assault rifle but as of season 4 the whole recoil has been minimized I guess it still follows the same pattern but much less so and it just feels really good to shoot it I think if I can get used to shooting this thing I'm going to start beaming people across all ranges it deals ton of damage when used right so it's definitely worth considering the other weapon in the B tier is going to be the M60 which not only can be attached with a sight as of this patch but the fire rate has also been marginally increased so it ches a little bit faster deals a little bit more damage I feel like the M60 recoil pattern which also has changed it mostly works the same where you have a hard recoil at the first few shots and then it's very smooth even smoother now as you continue firing so you can just go full Rambo it basically comes down to whichever play style you prefer use with these two different lmgs having the site is a nice addition but personally I don't feel like it makes that much of a difference cuz I got used to the M60 sites I guess it block a large part of your screen but it weren't that much of a problem or as much of a problem as people made them out to be in my opinion if anything I feel weird using a side rather than the actual iron sights but that is the B tier again that's where we put the L gun and M60 and then moving on in the E tier we have a weapon that I'm having a hard time finding the perfect place for but I think going to settle it right here and that is addition to heavy to season the double deagles the double deagles can shred if you hit consistent head shot or use consistent shots with them they are nearly Unstoppable again with the inor Crosshair being turned off so it's F static that helps with aiming them a lot they do lose their accuracy over longer ranges there's some spread no matter whether you're aiming down sights or not and in my opinion over longer ranges they're just not consistent enough even though they deal a lot of damage when they do hit however if you take it to mid-range or close range the deagles hit insanely hard especially if you combine them with other utilities or other gadgets and if you're heavy fighting against another heavy most of the times the deagles should win because they Havey let's say they're using a l Gunner M60 they're going to be standing still and spraying at you and you can just easily plink them in the head and kill them nearly instantly again the only reason I can't put the deagles in the S tier is that they aren't accurate enough and I feel like it comes down to a lot of RNG or Randomness whether you hit your shots over the longer ranges and I'm not a fan of RNG G because whenever I trust RNG it lets me down and I will never advocate for that for a weapon being good if it has a lot of RNG maybe it's just a spray pattern and I suck what do I know but either way that was it for heavy with the deagle in the E tier a huge thank you guys for watching this video if you have any disagreements which I'm sure some people will have let me know in the comments and uh yeah I'll see you all next time peace out,"The user provides their opinion on some of the weapons in the game finals season 4. The user believes that the bow is the worst weapon, categorizing it in the F tier. Despite it being buffed this season, the user finds it too inconsistent as a projectile weapon and not reliable enough compared to other weapons at the same level. The user also mentions that the 93 R, despite being buffed this season, is only slightly improved compared to season 3 and 2. They classify it in the E tier, suggesting that it doesn't pack much of a punch, especially as a weapon for a light. The user finds the weapon's power insufficient for their playstyle, which involves dealing a lot of damage quickly and then retreating. Even though the 93 R is easier to use now, with improved sights and spread, the user believes it still falls short. They also mention another unnamed weapon in the E tier which they feel maybe they are rating too low but feel it belongs there. The overall opinion on the current state of the game is that, although some weapons have been buffed, they are still not meeting players' expectations in terms of reliability and power. The user expressed dissatisfaction with the M26 matter, stating that although it can deliver substantial damage, it is more suitable for sustained damage and darting in and out of corners. They found the M26 matter to be ineffective in open play and one-on-one situations, often leading to death when trying to kill an enemy, especially a heavy or medium one. The user also mentioned that the current Meta is dominated by the SE 40, which can outperform the M26 matter in close combat or when playing corners, making the M26 matter and similar long-time-to-kill weapons less appealing.

The user has a more nuanced view of the dagger. Some people suggest it has been nerfed and is slower, particularly with the alternate fire backstep. However, the user found that after a slight adjustment period, they gained more control and made more kills with the dagger. They regard the changes as an overall buff, making it easier to use and more consistent. However, they acknowledged that it suffers from the same issues as the light class, implying that it may not be effective in all situations or play styles. 

Overall, the user seems dissatisfied with the weapon balancing in the game and believes that some weapons are not effective enough in the current Meta. They feel that the game might benefit from some adjustments to improve weapon functionality and balance. The user has expressed several opinions about weapon balancing and the overall state of the game. 

1. The user rates the sh1 1900 weapon in the D tier, viewing it as solid but unreliable. The user feels that it requires too much effort for too little reward, and its inconsistency, probably due to screen shake, makes it unworthy of a higher rating. 

2. The user also places the dagger in the D tier, but doesn't elaborate on why.

3. The sword is placed in the C tier. The user feels that recent changes to the sword have improved its accuracy, but that it takes time to adjust to. The lunge ability of the sword has also been improved, making it feel more like a dash attack. The user enjoys using the sword, but believes the C tier rating is fair when compared to other weapons. 

4. Throwing knives are also placed in the C tier. The user doesn't believe the recent buff, which allows the player to hold the right click and let go whenever they want, makes a significant difference to gameplay. The user feels it's more of a quality of life improvement than a necessary addition. 

5. The user is unhappy with the game offering the same season again, and this dissatisfaction affects their overall rating of the game. 

6. The user doesn't give a general opinion on the overall state of the game, but their comments suggest they may be dissatisfied with certain aspects of the game's current state, The user's opinions about the weapon balancing in the game are mixed. They feel that some weapons are not as effective as others. Specifically, the throwing knives are considered decent but not amazing due to their projectile nature and inability to compete well with heavy or medium weapons. The user also mentions the Cal 40 and the pike, implying that these are more effective weapons in the game.

The v9s gun is also discussed, with the user acknowledging that it's a solid weapon but lacking in damage. They appreciate the ability to attach a sight and the ease of tracking enemies, but critiqued the semi-auto trigger and unreliable hip fire. They also compared it with the M11 and pre-nerf xp54, stating it's not as impactful.

The user also placed the sword, Frog knives, and v9s in the C tier, implying these are decent but not the best options in the game. They suggest that players might be better off using other weapons.

The lh1 weapon is placed in B tier, with the user recognizing it as a solid weapon, particularly now that sights can be attached. However, they note that it has gotten an indirect nerf due to the direction the game's meta is heading, mentioning the seal 40 and pike again as more effective weapons.

Overall, the user seems to feel that the game's current state could be improved, particularly the balancing of certain weapons. The user suggests that the throwing knives, v9s, and lh1 The user noted a significant difference in the time to kill between the lh1 and other weapons like the pike, suggesting that the lh1 is a less effective weapon in the current meta. They found the lh1 to be not worth using, although they acknowledged it had been buffed recently.

The sr84 was also brought up, with the user commenting on how it had been nerfed to fire projectile shots past 4 meters. However, they still found it to be a good weapon, particularly for longer range combat. They argued that the sr84 might be better than the lh1 for fighting medium range combatants, as it requires less exposure to enemy fire.

The xp54, a previously top-tier weapon, was mentioned as having been nerfed, with a significant decrease in its damage per bullet. Despite this, the user still found it to be a great gun that was reliable and had a reasonably easy-to-control recoil pattern.

The M11 was ranked in the S tier by the user. They did not mention any specific changes to it, but they seemed to hold it in high regard compared to the other weapons.

The user's overall opinion on the current state of the game seemed mixed. While they appreciated some weapons like the M11, they were critical of others like the lh1 and had concerns about the effects of recent nerfs on weapons like the sr84 and xp54. The user expresses dissatisfaction with the game's weapon balancing, particularly with the M11 firearm. They note that the M11's performance has remained unchanged, and criticizes the game developers for not making any adjustments. The user appreciates the M11's high damage and good hip-fire accuracy, and finds the new non-world Crosshair setting and reticle addition beneficial, as they enhance targeting abilities. However, they criticize the weapon's overpowering performance compared to others, particularly the xp54, which they claim used to have a higher DPS but doesn't anymore. The user suggests that this imbalance leaves players with no reason to use any weapon other than the M11.

In terms of medium weapons, the user is particularly critical of the dual blades and the riot shield. They describe the dual blades as worse than the riot shield, and criticize them for their unreliability and the fact that they cause the player to lose health over time. Similarly, they express dislike for the riot shield, especially for its ineffectiveness in melee situations in its current state. 

Overall, the user's opinion of the game seems to be negative due to these weapon balancing issues, suggesting that the game is currently in an unhealthy state. The user has expressed several opinions about weapon balancing and the overall state of the game:

1. Riot Shield: The user mentions that the Riot Shield offers some protection and can provide a strategic advantage when combined with other items. However, compared to other weapons, the Riot Shield falls short and is placed in the D tier.

2. Famas: The Famas received a buff this season and can now have a sight added to it. However, the user feels that it is not hitting as hard as it should and is being overshadowed by the Pike. The Famas is placed in the C tier.

3. Model 1887: The user thinks highly of the Model 1887 due to its excellent performance in many situations. However, its effectiveness decreases in mid to long-range fights, especially against teams holding a position on high grounds. This weapon is placed in the B tier.

4. CL40: The CL40 got a buff this season, and the user states that its improved performance can be felt in gameplay. However, it's also described as ""annoying as hell to fight.""

In general, the user seems to have mixed feelings about the current state of the game. They appreciate the strategic possibilities offered by items like the Riot Shield and the recent buffs to certain weapons. However, they also express frustration about the Famas' lack of power and the Model 1887's limited range. The user also finds fighting against the CL40 annoying. The user's opinions regarding weapon balancing in the game are as follows:

1. The user finds it frustrating to play against light and medium weapons because they require little effort to get a lot of kills. However, these weapons are criticized for having only four shots per magazine and being outperformed by many other weapons in the game. The user also mentions that these weapons are ineffective against high ground targets, which further reduces their reliability.

2. The AKM has been slightly nerfed in the current season, reducing its magazine capacity from 35 to 32 bullets, which the user feels in some cases. However, the addition of an attachable sight is seen as a significant improvement as it improves accuracy, and the user feels the trade-off of fewer bullets for increased accuracy is worthwhile. The AKM is considered to be a consistent and hard-hitting weapon with manageable recoil.

3. The user debates the positioning of the F car in the A tier, suggesting it could potentially be moved down to the B tier. Even though the AKM should theoretically be superior, the user finds the F car to be a satisfying weapon to use. It's described as hard-hitting, consistent, and comes with a sight. But the user suggests its preference might be due to familiarity with the F car.

4. The user mentions another weapon they enjoy but doesn't provide enough information to form an opinion.

In terms of the overall state of the game, the user does not provide a clear overall opinion. However The user is expressing a positive opinion about the revolver in the game. They appreciate the addition of a sight to the revolver which has improved its usability significantly. They find it easier to aim and consider it a good weapon for medium to long-range combat. The user places the revolver, along with the AKM and the F car, in the A tier of weapons in the game. 

However, they believe the Pike is the best weapon overall and deserves a spot in the S+ tier. The Pike is praised for its hard-hitting damage at long ranges and its seemingly non-existent damage fall-off. While they acknowledge the Pike's scope can be awkward to use, and its hip-fire is less than ideal, they still find its power and accuracy outweigh these minor downsides. They consider it a must-have weapon for the season. 

Overall, the user seems satisfied with the current state of the game, particularly in terms of weapon balancing. The user believes that the mgl 32, despite being buffed this season, is still not a good weapon. They suggest that if the weapon exploded on impact with an enemy, it would significantly improve its effectiveness. However, they admit that they haven't used it enough to fully understand its potential damage. 

The user also discusses the spear, which they believe may have been wrongly positioned in the E tier. Despite the weapon receiving a buff this season that increased the run speed modifier during the secondary Spin Attack, the user still doesn't find it enjoyable to use. They argue that, the recent nerf to the mesh Shield, which is often used with melee weapons like the spear, has further decreased its effectiveness. 

Another weapon mentioned is the ks trree, which the user also ranks in the E tier, suggesting that they don't find it very good. However, they acknowledge that their rating may be subjective and others may disagree. 

Overall, the user seems dissatisfied with the current state of the game, specifically regarding weapon balancing. They believe that certain weapons are still underpowered despite recent buffs and that the nerf to the mesh Shield has negatively affected gameplay. The user has several detailed opinions regarding weapon balancing in the game. 

1. The utility weapon that can destroy walls is considered inconsistent due to its projectile firing mechanism. It is seen as lacking in damage, even when every shot hits. The user suggests that this weapon, possibly the ks23, be able to headshot to reward accuracy and make it feel more impactful, possibly improving its rating to a B2 or C tier weapon.

2. The spear and K free weapons are placed in the E tier, suggesting they are not highly regarded in their current state.

3. The flamethrower, previously nerfed, has been indirectly impacted again due to a change to the mesh Shield, which was an important part of its kit. The previous strategy of using the shield and flamethrower together is no longer viable. However, the user has found some success using the gravity Cube with the flamethrower, due to its range. The user believes it is better than the spear and K free, therefore placing it in the D tier.

4. The Sledge is highly regarded by the user, being named the best melee weapon. Its ability to one-shot and its high impact, especially when playing heavy, give it more utility. It is placed in the C tier.

In terms of the overall game state, the user seems to have mixed feelings. They appreciate the challenge and strategy involved in weapon use, but also express frustration with certain changes and the balance of certain weapons. The The user expresses that the game is largely reliable with certain weapons, such as the winch claw, proving particularly effective when used strategically. However, the user also notes the negative impact of the mes Shield Nerf, suggesting it has significantly affected the performance of certain weapons, notably the sa26. The user suggests this weapon has become less reliable as a result, with the loss of the shield meaning poor strategic decisions can lead to easy defeat.

The user also mentions the S6 weapon, which they describe as ""an all or nothing sort of weapon"". While it still has some value, particularly when used with a winch, the absence of a shield makes it riskier to use.

The user expresses disappointment with the Sledge and SFL 16, which they rank in the C tier, indicating that these weapons are not living up to expectations.

The user expresses satisfaction with the luig gun, suggesting it feels good to use following changes to its recoil pattern. Despite starting off with minimal recoil, it picks up more like an assault rifle as it continues to fire. However, the recoil has been minimized in the current season, which makes it easier and more satisfying to use. The user suggests that if they get used to this weapon, they could be very effective at all ranges. Overall, the user suggests the luig gun is worth considering due to its potential for high damage. 

In general, the user seems to have a mixed opinion about the current state of the game, praising certain elements The user provides detailed opinions on weapon balancing and their views on the game's current state. They discuss the changes to the M60, noting its improved fire rate and the ability to attach a sight. The user comments that the M60's recoil pattern, which starts with hard recoil and then smooths out, works well with continuous firing. They don't think that the added sight makes a significant difference as they had gotten used to the M60's sights. They also discuss the L gun, although they don't provide many details.

The user goes on to discuss a weapon they categorize as E tier, the double deagles. They note that these weapons can be very powerful with consistent headshots and benefit from the static inor Crosshair. However, they find the double deagles less accurate over longer ranges and therefore less consistent, although they do deal a lot of damage when they hit. At close to mid-range, they find the deagles to be very effective, particularly when combined with other utilities or gadgets.

Overall, the user seems to have a mixed opinion about the game's current state. They seem to appreciate some of the updates but also criticise certain aspects, such as the M60's sight and the double deagles' performance at longer ranges. The user seems to have mixed opinions about the weapon balancing in the game. Particularly, they have concerns about the deagles (Desert Eagle guns). They believe that the deagles could be in the S tier (superior tier) but their accuracy is not up to the mark, which prevents them from being top tier. The user also mentions the influence of RNG (Random Number Generator) in hitting shots over longer ranges with the deagles, which they do not appreciate. They believe that reliance on RNG can let players down and they do not support the idea of a weapon being good if it involves a lot of RNG. The user suggests that this could be due to the spray pattern, or their own skill level. Overall, the user seems to be unsatisfied with the current state of weapon balancing in the game. They also encourage other players to share their opinions, indicating an openness to discussion and differing viewpoints."
The Finals best weapons,ZlensG9FoSM,7 Weapons You NEED To Use in The Finals…,I peaked at number 13 on the global leaderboards for the final season 3 and these are my top seven picks for weapons you need to use starting off with possibly the most underrated weapon on this list the Famas when the Famas was first released in season 2 it was pretty weak and no one really used it over the F car but with season 3 came some very nice Buffs to the Famas making it one of my favorite weapons to use right now my all-time favorite weapon though would have to be the xp54 as this thing completely melts anyone up close and even does a fair amount of damage at range not to mention it has great fire rate and literally zero recoil whatsoever also the optic making the MP5 possibly the second best gun in the game right now but maybe not as good as the sa 12 which has long dominated the finals with many including myself saying that it's been op since the game released but to be fair it has received some recent nerves but that doesn't change the fact that you can still two shot a up close and pretty much out DPS anyone inside the sa2 is a beast but by far the most fun shotgun in my opinion is the model 1887 for medium this thing is a montage machine and may actually be the best weapon for the medium class right now it does take a little more skill than the sa2 but once you get it down every light in the lobby will fear you unless they're using an lh1 which recently got buffed into being the best weapon we've ever seen in the finals allowing you to basically twoot everyone it did get a Nerf pretty quickly after because it was literally breaking the game but it's still the best weapon in the game for the light class the lh1 definitely made a lot of people rage but probably not as much as the prime F car which basically made the light class unplayable with them getting instantly killed whenever they got into the line of sight of a medium using it the F car has now received some well deserve Nerf but it's still my go-to weapon of choice for the medium because of its consistency and damage at range not to mention it's one of the few guns in the game with an optic and finally the Lewis gun my go-to weapon for the heavy whenever I'm not feeling the sa2 this thing does prime FC car damage with almost 50 bullets with the only downsides being that it has more recoil and iron sights but even with that it's still one of the best weapons for heavy right now let me know what you guys think of my list in the comments and be sure to drop your favorite weapons and why down below

mainly focusing on seven weapons: the Famas, the xp54, the MP5, the sa 12, the model 1887, the lh1, and the F car.

1. The Famas: Initially weak when released in season 2, it received significant buffs in season 3 and is now considered underrated and a favorite for the user.
2. The xp54: Described as the all-time favorite due to its high damage at range, great fire rate, and zero recoil. It's possibly the second-best gun in the game.
3. The MP5: It has a great optic and is considered possibly the second best gun in the game.
4. The sa 12: Long dominated the finals and has been considered overpowered since the game's release. Despite recent nerfs, it's still powerful, especially at close range.
5. The model 1887: The most fun shotgun for the user, especially for the medium class. It requires more skill than the sa2, but is highly effective.
6. The lh1: Recently buffed to become possibly the best weapon in the game, particularly for the light class. It was nerfed quickly due to it breaking the game, but it's still powerful.
7. The F car: It made the light class unplayable due to its power, leading to instant kills. It received some well-deserved nerfs, but The user seems to have mixed opinions on weapon balancing in the game. They mention a gun with an optic and the Lewis gun as their favorite weapons, especially for the heavy role.

The Finals best weapons,F5ftJrD5RME,I tried and ranked EVERY weapon in The Finals SEASON 4 (Tier List),so we are now a few weeks into season 4 we've got some new weapons and balance changes to shake up the minute a bit and I wanted to let you all know what the best and worst weapons to use this season R I thought about making this list earlier but decided that I wanted to do this video later so that I could see if things were actually good or not instead of giving a possibly incorrect first impression and to give Embark some time to Nerf or buff some weapons as always I have everything timestamped if you want to find a specific weapon and just a reminder that if I put something low on this tier list it doesn't mean that you can't do well with or enjoy that weapon let me know if you agreee or disagree with any of my rankings down below and with that let's get started the M60 did get a pretty nice buff this season with both the increased fire rate and the addition of an equipable Red Dot site and it is a solid pick for any heavy the part where it has issues though is at range where the Dual 50s the Pike and the Lewis gun all beat it out all of which are very good this season in terms of ttk it is very slightly below the Lewis gun so it's technically the worst option but it's not a bad pick i' place it in the a tier the throw is a pretty accessible weapon that has the potential to be a good utility weapon and also a good crowd control weapon however it does have some notable drawbacks like having really low DPS and not having great range it's a niche gun that can be used to good AFF Landing it in the C tier the mgl needs some sort of a rework or a buff and while you can do good with it there's usually better options available and it's very inconsistent APS height jump pads and pretty much any close-range weapon are counters to it however it does have the ability to do some really nice structural damage and it's a pretty fun weapon to use I'll put it at the bottom of the C tier the Lewis gun is still fantastic and with the new recoil changes that were made to it this season it should be even more accessible this is in my opinion still one of the Heavy's best weapons it's super consistent has pretty good range and they made The Recoil more manageable which was previously its main drawback the range is still really good and it's still a very good pick even though everyone is busy using the Dual 50s it goes into the S tier the ks23 is an interesting gun I used it a lot while I was playing ranked ta last season and if you have very precise aim and can manage the bullet travel time and drop off this gun can be really good the ability to destroy the arena is an added bonus I personally find that using it with winch claw makes it really powerful I placed it at the bottom of the a tier the sa 12 is still one of the top guns in the game in general the time to kill versus lights and mediums is ridiculous and while using it with the mes Shield isn't quite as strong as it used to be this gun itself is still a beast I'd place it near the top of a tier the sledgehammer kind of dominated casual lobbies last season with the introduction of the winch claw but since then it hasn't quite been as popular while the damage is still great on it and the destructive capabilities are still quite good it does struggle against movement abilities and gadgets and with the current meta being more ranged focused this season it's going to go into the B tier the spear is in a bit of an awkward spot it has a little bit more range than the Sledge but that's about all that it has going for it the sludge has more utility and the old fire attack on the spear is practically useless due to how inconsistent the hit registration is it's a usable weapon you can do well with but Sledge is pretty much always a better pick Landing the spear in C tier the akimbo pistols added this season are some of the most stylish and the best weapons in the game at the moment the range is really good The Recoil is very manageable and it has great damage as well you do need half decent aim to use it at its full potential but that won't stop me from putting it in the S tier in general with the Nerf to the akm mag size and the rise of the model and the pike akm is no longer one of the top weapons in in the game but it is still very solid it has pretty good damage per mag and is good at bursting down heavy Shields and that larger mag size also makes it a good gun to run with the heal beam i' place it in the a tier for this season the Famas has been fairing a bit better as of late it has one of the best ctks versus Heavies out of the medium ARs and is a pretty decent gun the hit fire is also really good on the gun the new scope that was also added helps out those who like a longer range play style with the gun as well but it is going to be beat out by the pike so be aware of that I'm going to place it in the a tier right next to the akm the F car is also a fine pick this season well it's not as potent as it was back in season 1 it's silly pretty decent weapon and it actually has the fastest time to kill versus lights out of the medium ARS just like the others I'm going to place the F car in a tier so as you can see from this list we are more or less in a balanced state in my opinion with the medium ARs and you can really pick whatever suits your play style or the situation more the cl40 got buffed in the beginning of the season and a lot of people felt that this gun was too oppressive because because of this the Cal 40 did get a Nerf in the latest update Bringing Down the total damage the splash damage and increasing the self damage but they did increase the max size by one so now APS height and simply getting up in a cl40 user's face are all counters to this gun picking it not really that much of a threat if you know how to deal with it while fighting grenade launchers might be annoying for some it's really not that strong and goes into the C tier after the latest changes the revolver has always been a stylish Niche pick that has had some really good headshot and dueling potential it got a sight added this season which I originally thought was going to make the gun very good but unfortunately the pike exists and has pretty much beat it out in every single category Ember we really need to talk about the range on this thing it's horrible despite this it's still a solid enough weapon and if we were basing things off of style it'd go in the S tier but in practicality and because the pike exists I have to put it into the B tier the model hasn't received any Buffs ever so why is it so powerful this season it's mainly due to the other medium ARS being nerfed which really were its only competition in the medium weapon slot it's easily the best close- range option in the medium's loadout making it an S tier pick pair this with dematerializer and you have a very scary combination the dual blades are a bit of an unfortunate weapon medium already isn't a good melee class and it doesn't help that the dual blades deflect is super inconsistent you're better off just larning the riot shield for now if you want to play medium melee Landing this weapon into the D tier right Shield is another goofy weapon that I find to be a lot of fun but it doesn't do as well in higher level lobbies for the most part flamethrower is pretty much a hard counter to it and coordinated teams will exploit you only having a melee weapon on medium very easily but it's a great weapon to have a laugh with and it can be really good against uncoordinated teams I'd place it in the C tier the pike released this season super strong but it did get nerfed a little bit in the recent update it is still very good but now it sits below some of the assault rifles and ttk on mediums and Heavies however the strength of this gun is still the melts light players and the crazy amount of range that it provides this gun did get some much needed balancing because it was stronger than any of the other medium guns but it still remains in the S tier another of my favorite weapons the bow did get a buff this season making it a little bit more powerful but against good players it's still going to struggle a little bit it's not a bad Weapon by any means but I'm going to place it at the top of c-tier because it can perform well in the hands of a skilled player it's just that for the most part there are better options the 93r got a hip fire buff this season but it is still one of the worst light weapons the time to kill is really not that great and most of the time you'll probably end up being more of an annoyance than an actual threat I have to place it in the djer trust me I want this gun to be good but it just really isn't you're pretty much better off using any other of the lights weapons right now I've always said that the only thing holding the v9s back was the muzzle climb and the sze for this weapon being absolutely horrible but with the Red Dot site added the season that has been fixed and now that the xp54 has been nerfed it really doesn't have much competition anymore to be be considered one of the best light weapons at the moment they did change the fire rate recently but they uped the damage to compensate I heard some of yall were binding fire weapon to scroll wheel and that's why the change was made regardless the gun is super good right now I'm going to place it in the S tier the sh1 1900 is one of those high-risk High reward guns that is really powerful in the right hands but can also get you killed the damage potential for this gun is insane but you do kind of have to be right in the enemy's face to make use of it which is very dangerous for light I'm going to place it in the a tier the matter is a gun that wishes it could be the model but unfortunately just doesn't quite reach that Mark it's still a decent gun but the damage is worse than the S off and you'll pretty much always be better off just running the model instead if you want to use a shotgun with a little bit of range on it I'm going to place it in the B tier but if the model ever gets nerfed or this gun gets buffed I might place it a bit higher the xp54 really got hit hard this season with the damage being decreased by two per bullet now that doesn't sound like much but it's actually a lot it's still a fairly consistent gun it's just no longer consistent at getting kills I'd place it in the low a tier for now but I would really recommend that for the most part you use something like the v9s in ranked for now if you're playing light the M11 has risen up a little bit in the meta now that the xp54 has been nerfed and while it hasn't exactly taken its place or risen to the xp54 former power it's gotten a new Red Dot site and it's doing pretty well this season i' plac this weapon in the a tier the sr84 has never been good in cash out and the only point where it was a problem was in terminal attack and an annoyance in power shift it's still easily stopped by any Shields and now it has to contend with the lh1 now having a scope and mediums having the pike not to mention that it is no longer hit scan past 40 m and the scope is still weird making it so that there's not really any reason to run this gun at the moment it's going to have to go into the D tier unfortunately the amount of effort that you have to put in to do well with this gun is usually better used with something else dagger did get a buff this season that allows you to hold down the backstab button for as long as want which is pretty cool but unfortunately when there's lots of really good close-range weapons the dagger just ends up not doing as well the dagger also thrives off of chaos and doesn't Faire as well in the final round I'd place it in the C tier and Mark if you want to make people use this weapon without having to BU it I suggest adding a camit skin to the game I know I'd definitely be using it the sword is easily the best melee weapon in the game not only because of its high damage profile but because it's really hard to hit a good sword player especially one with Evas of Dash this is easily the most viable melee weapon with people even being successful with it in high level ranked I'm going to put it at the top of a tier I wouldn't necessarily disagree with you if you consider this weapon to be S tier but for me personally I find that if you have decent enough aim and good positioning you're able to counter this weapon the knives have been a bit interesting they don't require a Reload but they need to hit head shot to compete with the other light weapons in ttk values and they also are a projectile weapon Heavies that use melee weapons or flamethrower will probably think that this weapon is busted but in ranked I almost never never see this weapon used anymore there's just better options I'd put it in the B tier lh1 isn't a bad gun but at the moment it's kind of outclassed by the pike it did have a scope added to it which is nice and it's still a solid weapon but in the current meta there are usually better options I'd place it in the B tier and if it gets a buff or the pike gets nerfed I could see it getting placed higher and that's my tier list for this season I hope you all found this informative let me know in the comments what you think of it subscribe for mostly weekly videos on the finals and I'll see you next time,"The user provides opinions on several weapons and their balance changes in the new season 4:

1. M60: The user sees this as a solid pick for any heavy player due to the buff it received this season, which included an increased fire rate and the addition of an equippable Red Dot site. However, the user notes that this weapon struggles at range, falling short to the Dual 50s, the Pike, and the Lewis gun. It's placed in A tier.

2. Thore: The user finds it to be a pretty accessible weapon with good utility and crowd control potential. However, it is criticized for its low DPS and not great range. Despite its drawbacks, the user still sees it as a niche gun with good effect, placing it in the C tier.

3. MGL: According to the user, this weapon is in need of a rework or a buff. Despite its potential for structural damage and its fun factor, it's viewed as inconsistent and often outperformed by other options. It's placed at the bottom of C tier.

4. Lewis gun: The user highly rates this weapon, stating it's still fantastic even after the new recoil changes. 

The user's overall opinion of the current state of the game seems to be positive, appreciating the changes made in the new season and the impact they've had on the overall game balance. However, they also highlight the need for improvements in certain weapons, suggesting that while the game is currently Opinions on weapon balancing and overall game state:

1. The Heavy's weapon is viewed favorably. It is considered one of the best weapons due to its consistency, good range, and manageable recoil. Although other players are more interested in the Dual 50s, the user still places it in the S tier.

2. The KS23 is seen as an interesting gun that requires precise aim and management of bullet travel time and drop off. It is also useful for its ability to destroy the arena, especially when used with winch claw. It is placed in the bottom of the A tier.

3. The SA 12 is highly rated and considered one of the top guns in the game. It has a quick kill time against lights and mediums. Although not as strong when used with the mes Shield, it is still a very powerful weapon and placed near the top of the A tier.

4. The Sledgehammer has lost some popularity, despite its great damage and destructive capabilities. It struggles against movement abilities and gadgets, and with the current meta being more ranged, it is placed in the B tier.

5. The Spear is seen as an awkward weapon with a bit more range than the Sledge but lacking in utility. Its old fire attack is seen as practically useless due to inconsistent hit registration. The Sledge is seen as a better pick, placing the Spear in the C tier.

6. The newly added akimbo pistols are considered some of the best and most stylish weapons. 1. The AKM, despite its nerf in magazine size, is still considered a solid choice of weapon due to its good damage per magazine and effectiveness against heavy shields. It's also considered beneficial to pair with the heal beam. The AKM is placed in the A tier.
2. The Famas is faring better recently, with good CtK against Heavies and decent hit fire. The addition of a new scope lends itself to long-range play styles but it is outperformed by the Pike. The Famas is placed in A tier.
3. The F Car is still a good choice despite not being as potent as it was in the first season. It's the fastest time-to-kill weapon against lights in the medium AR category. The F Car is placed in A tier.
4. The weapons are considered balanced, with the choice of weapon depending on the player's style and situation.
5. The Cl40, which was buffed at the start of the season, was initially seen as overbearing. After a nerf that reduced its total damage, splash damage and increased self-damage, it's now seen as manageable if approached correctly. The Cl40 is placed in the C tier.
6. The revolver is seen as a stylish, niche pick with good headshot potential.

Overall, players seem to appreciate the current balance of weapons in the game, finding it fair and open to various play styles. The recent nerfs and buffs have been generally well-re The player initially thought the addition of a sight to an unnamed weapon would significantly improve it, but after comparing it to the pike, they found that the pike outperforms it in every category. They also mentioned that the Ember has poor range, but nonetheless, it is a reasonably solid weapon. If the ranking was based on style, it would be in the S tier, but due to its limited practicality and the existence of the pike, they placed it in the B tier.

The Model is surprisingly powerful this season despite not receiving any buffs. This power seems to be due to the nerfing of other medium ARS, which were its primary competition. The Model is considered the best close-range option in the medium loadout, making it an S-tier pick, especially when paired with a dematerializer.

Dual blades are considered unfortunate due to their inconsistency and the fact that the medium class is not suitable for melee. The player recommends using the riot shield if you want to play medium melee, placing the dual blades into the D tier. 

The riot shield, while fun, is not effective in higher-level lobbies, especially against coordinated teams that exploit the fact that you only have a melee weapon on medium. It's placed in the C tier. 

The pike, which was released this season, was very powerful but has been nerfed slightly. It still sits below some of the assault rifles in terms of time-to-kill (TTK) on mediums and The overall user opinion on the current state of the game is mixed, with some weapon balancing appreciated and others critiqued. 

Detailed opinions on weapon balancing:

1. Bow: The bow received a buff this season, making it more powerful. However, it still struggles against skilled players. The bow is not a bad weapon and can perform well in the hands of a skilled player. However, there are usually better options available. It is placed in the top of C-tier.

2. 93r: This light weapon received a hip fire buff this season, but it's still considered one of the worst light weapons. The time to kill is not great and it's often more of an annoyance than a threat. It is placed in the D-tier.

3. V9s: Previously held back by a horrible muzzle climb and size, the addition of a Red Dot site has fixed these issues. The nerfing of the xp54 has also reduced competition, making it one of the best light weapons currently. A recent change in fire rate was compensated with increased damage, making the gun very good and placing it in the S-tier.

4. SH1 1900: This is a high-risk, high-reward gun with incredible damage potential. However, it's very risky as it requires close proximity to the enemy. It is placed in the A-tier.

5. Matter: The Matter is a decent gun but falls short in comparison to the Model. The damage is worse than the The user has several opinions about the current state of the game and its weapon balancing.

1. XP54: The user feels the XP54 has been nerfed too hard this season with its damage being decreased by two per bullet. While it's still a consistent gun, it's no longer consistently getting kills. The user would rank it in the low A tier.

2. V9S: The user recommends the V9S for playing in ranked mode.

3. M11: The user believes that the M11 has risen up in the meta now that the XP54 has been nerfed. Although it hasn't exactly replaced the XP54, it's doing well this season with its new Red Dot site. The user would rank it in the A tier.

4. SR84: The user doesn't believe the SR84 has ever been good in ""cash out"" and is easily stopped by any shields. Its usefulness is further diminished by the LH1 now having a scope and mediums having the Pike. The user would rank it in the D tier.

5. Dagger: The dagger received a buff this season allowing you to hold down the backstab button indefinitely. However, the user feels that when there are lots of good close-range weapons, the dagger doesn't fare as well. They suggest adding a camit skin to boost its appeal. The user would rank it in the C tier.

6. Sword: The user believes the sword is the best melee weapon in the game due to its The user's opinion on weapon balancing in the game ""Vas of Dash"" is that the game has some weapons that are more viable than others. The user believes the melee weapon in the game is the most viable, particularly for high-level ranked play, and ranks it at the top of their tier list. However, they also note that it can be countered with good aim and positioning. 

The user finds the knife weapon interesting due to its lack of reload requirement but acknowledges its need for a headshot to compete with other light weapons in terms of time-to-kill (TTK) values. They also mention it as a projectile weapon. 

The user feels that heavy weapon users who prefer melee weapons or flamethrowers may find this weapon overpowered, but they rarely see it used in ranked games, implying a possible imbalance. The user believes there are better options, thus placing it in the B tier. 

The user thinks the LH1 gun is outclassed by the Pike, despite the addition of a scope making it a solid choice. They suggest that in the current meta, there are usually better options, so they place it in the B tier as well. However, they suggest that if it gets buffed or the Pike gets nerfed, its ranking could improve. 

In terms of the overall state of the game, the user implies that there is room for improvement in weapon balancing, as some weapons are currently more viable than others. They also suggest that changes in the weapon"
The Finals best weapons,m1wXCTz13K0,Best Weapon in The Finals 🤯,the best weapon in the finals is the r357 this revolver is part of the medium build and with 74 base damage at 148 head shot you can threap any character in the game there's only Six Bullets in the clip but even without head shot you can one clip any build give it a try before the beta ends and like and follow for more because,"The user seems to have a positive opinion about the weapon balancing in the game, specifically praising the r357 revolver from the medium build. They highlight its high base damage (74) and headshot damage (148) as major positives, allowing players to potentially defeat any character in the game. The user also mentions the revolver's limitation of having only six bullets in the clip, which appears to be a balance mechanic that prevents it from being overpowered. However, they believe that even this limitation doesn't hinder the weapon's effectiveness, as it still has the potential to eliminate any build with a single clip. The user encourages others to give the r357 a try before the beta ends, indicating that they believe it's a strong choice. However, they didn't provide a broader opinion on the overall state of the game."

The Finals Season 3,Um4Hyd2yjdk,The Finals Season 3 looks GOOD ðŸ‘€,the final season 3 is out now and it looks good this game is made by former Battlefield developers that brings a huge amount of Destruction and they've also got some pretty sick Cosmetics if you're into changing your look but the new season brings a ton of new changes and new content including their best map yet theot 1568 is the new map inspired by 16th century Japan and it's packed with temples Gardens and Paper Walls and as usual everything is totally destructible and we've got three new weapons to use the recurve bows for the light class with some medium to long range damage depending on how far you pull back the bow the dual blades are there for the medium class bringing some fast-paced melee action along with a block and deflect and the heavy class has the Spear a melee weapon with some range and some solid damage you've also got two new tools a thermal board that's used to breach a wall and the winch claw that's basically a giant roadhog hook for yanking and stabbing enemies with a spear very cool and if you're really into it they've got an entirely new battle pass with free and paid tiers so you've got something to earn either way let me know down below do you still play the finals what do you think about season 3 and if you haven't checked it out in a while are you going to go back,"The feedback does not provide specific opinions about the CL-40 grenade launcher or weapon balancing in the game 'The Finals'.

The Finals Season 4,42c8P7OBYzg,How the #1 Light DOMINATES Ranked in The Finals Season 4,so in today's video we're back on ranked in the finals as always I'm going to be giving you guys a unique look inside the mind letting you know what's going on in my head as I'm playing basically why I'm doing what I'm doing throughout the entire game I saw a ton of comments letting me know that the M11 is the move right now so that's what we're going to be using in today's video if you have any other build suggestions make sure to leave them in the comments I'm going to be trying out a ton of different builds that you guys suggest to me in the upcoming videos all right let's get into it we're going to contest Vault number one here getting a little crazy early trying to deal some damage from High Ground nice we get that quick aim I'm going to pop an invis and look for a stun play now oh my gosh I'm caught on everything man oh my gosh that got really unlucky I just got caught on that wall so I couldn't move and help my teammate trying to help with this heavy up close now I'm using the dashes just to make him Miss oh unfortunately I go down there get the res off got to just keep fighting for this Vault here I'm going to go for a stun play I'm going to reload go for an invis stun play up close here TR to get in the limb I thought I had my stun in my hand I don't know why I didn't stun the heavy he's going to be low but I know I'm low on ammo so I'm just playing cover nice teammate gets the kill we would have cleaned that up if we had to I think now we look to take Vault and get over to cash out B that's what I'm going to start doing go ahead and take this on over to cash out B not a bad first fight was a little awkward to be honest but that invis stun play is so critical to this build getting up close and making them not have any abilities with the stun is so massive to not just inst dying because you still die really quick on light so the stuns really really important when using this M11 I would say so we're getting ready for purple or pink to make a push and I do spot them we're going to play this High Ground as long as we can try and just get as much damage the m1's really really rough at range so I know I'm not going to do too much so honestly at this point we're getting collapse on I don't know it might be purple and pink it's kind of hard for me to tell it looked like a lot of people so I'm going to kind of fall off and not get too in close until I have to here like right now I might go for an invis play make sure the stuns reloaded unfortunately I accidentally ruined my invis by dashing too early but still kind of worked looking to help get that elimination I see one guy behind me so I'm trying to create space throw that just in case both my teammates are dead at this point so I have to play the delay game a little bit so that's exactly what I'm about to do here I'm just playing the cash out delay we have two two pinks three purples I can delay with the stun I think my teammates need to respawn [Music] here out delaying as much as I can here that's all I'm focused on doing using utility to delay no he's one HP I think we get it though yes we get it I delayed just enough so even though I die there literally the goal is just delay delay delay we use the frag grenades to get him off the point once or twice and I was going to look for an invis stun if I had time but the heavy just sent me so I had to just kind of try to fight it and delay as much as I could works out there pretty perfect we get the point and that was pretty well played to be honest you just have to play the delay sometimes can't worry about kills or anything like that and we're right next to Vault number four so we're going to go ahead and start this up as well now they did already start Cash Out D it looks like orange did that so I think we're just going to go ahead and bring this over to C and I hear a lot of fighting over here so what most likely will happen at this point is we're going to go ahead and start C we might have a team close to us but if we don't oh yep see they're already holding us all good so it looks like they're trying to contest The Vault early that's absolutely fine and it looks like looks like it's pink contesting and there's only one left so I don't know how they died so quick oh my God I just got absolutely melted I just got absolutely melted that might have been the quickest 150 damage I've ever seen but my teammates clean it up so hey it's going to happen sometimes we take it we take the team wipe and now we got to get over to C and get this started so yeah like I was saying we're going to go ahead and get cash out C started here I thought maybe the team would be over by the point already they held us earlier but now they're already pushing back in here and I'm going to try to help my teammate get that first Alim using the invis stun Play That's So free with the M11 because up close this thing just absolutely melts I'm going to see if they go for the revive he's already behind me this is going to be tricky using the dash to get out see if they chase I'm going to go for this kill he's already weak get that kill the teammate's right behind me I don't have a grenade he's weak though so he's not pushing we can use this time to reposition we're going to use the invis for that unfortunately I can't get back up to the cash out in time so I think I just stick the res on my teammate and we regroup somehow it delayed I don't know how the cash out got delayed but they didn't grab it but I think we're not going to have enough time still hopefully I get that kill I do we have two left on pink oh my gosh that fire does so much damage that was my bad I shouldn't have even pushed that popping inis and I want to re hit from the same angle there's a lot of chaos I need to play this smart purple's here too I think I just go for a Cash Out Steel in the midst of all the chaos so I'm going just come oh my gosh this dude just hanging out over here what do we got two purples three pinks they might be up here we're going to start by popping the [Music] invis wow he spots me I thought the invis would do a better job at kind of hiding me there and it also looks like my teammate is just maybe dced or he's AFK I'm not really sure but so unfortunately we do lose that point but we do have time to get over to a um I'm going to try to Res my teammate quick it looks like our other teammate is lagging out or something I'm not sure he's having some kind of issues but all good we'll get our teammate up here looks like our teammate's back now he's moving around and we can go ahead and contest a here everybody's going to be over here there's only 47 seconds left so going to look to third party this late I do not want to get involved too early but we also only have 39 seconds so just this is all about timing really I'm checking who's alive how many are alive and based on that that's when I'm going to enter the fight I think it's a little early now but the teammate's kind of going for it so I'm going to just send some nades in here pop the invis get the stun this dude's going to be low we have two two purple one orange that's a teammate we're going to get on this point I like this stick I think we have time too I'm holding the the door this is really well played this is unfortunate I'm just holding a frag we get this though this is perfectly played to be honest I'll throw frag just in case but yeah we played that absolutely perfect to get that last point that was really well done 6K damage Nine Kills not the most kills are the most damage but what I really loved about that round was how we played the the cash outs the way that we delayed when we needed to the way that we timed our pushes that was a really solid round on uh how to play the cash out points really effectively all right let's get into this second game here head on over to Vault number one so I'm going to take a bit of a wider angle here cuz I'm expecting them to be super headon I'm going to look to pop an invis here and see if I can't get a rat play I might have popped that a little early yeah I popped the invis a little early that's unfortunate but I'm still going to try to look for this R play yeah they just weren't where I was hoping I was hoping they were a little closer they weren't it's pretty unlucky we're going to look for an invis rat play on the left they just hard committed to the right and push my teammates like they just sent it so little unlucky but we can look for the same play again here yeah we got to get out of there see if they chase they might they seem aggressive doesn't don't get any hits on those so I'm assuming they're not chasing I still hear them get the res here on our teammate we just want to get the get the res as quick as we can other teammate will have to probably use a token actually we can just grab him right here I don't know what I'm saying yeah let's go ahead and grab that honestly as my teammate's sticking that res I'm going to start working over to a and look to deal a little damage figure out what's going on in this fight just get a little info here and I already hear somebody trying to steal this point so as we can see we got everybody up and alive so it's really weird that people are able to steal right now but go ahead reload the stun and we're going to look to deal some damage here I'm going to look for this kill no I ran out of ammo see if he chases he doesn't wow I ran out of ammo that was a free kill it's all good though Health starts regening we see one might fall no he makes a jump all right I'm going to use this jump pad to take High Ground back here make sure the stuns reloaded poping inbiz let's try and get involved a little bit see if he chases orange is full dead I'm taking damage from everywhere we're going to reposition to this jump pad we have full purple and full uh Pink I'm expecting them to go for the steel here wow what was that the model yeah that thing does too much damage man if he has any other gun I just insta melt him and back off so we're not going to have time to get over to cash out a so we can just go ahead and move on over to Vault number three pretty unlucky situation there teammates went down kind of early I tried to get involved in the fight as much as I could but just too many teams and we didn't have a full unit so just is what it is I'm going to go ahead and grab The High Ground here as quick as I can just starting fights on The High Ground makes it a lot easier so you don't just get collapsed on but ended up not even having anybody push over and we can just kind of freely go over to cash out D here it looks like sounds like a lot of fighting on the other Vault maybe not really sure now they're kind of close I might look for a kill here this is simply just to weaken the other team by getting rid of one of their numbers like there's not really a purpose to this fight and I don't want to overcommit cuz looking for the kill overc committing for the kill is purposeless right now I was just looking for a free elimination now I have guys on my roof so I'm going to get out of here this is not a situation I want to fight there's not really a point to it I could have maybe got a free kill but he backed off so now we back off we don't want to overc commit to the kill I'm going to start working my way upstairs here not trying to overcommit too much we see one so we know orange is pushing in and I thought I saw Pink as well so already this is starting to look like it's going to get a bit chaotic so high ground's going to be really key here dealing as much damage as we can the M11 is very very weak from range so I know that I'm not dealing much damage there but still applying the pressure making it feel like I'm doing more than I actually am to them can be good sometimes come over here take a different roof just so we're not all kind of stuck on the same spot trying to get some info here see what what these teams are trying to do they're looking for maybe a jump pad play to group up on the roofs dealing a decent amount of damage there actually we have pink and purple here that's going to be a free elimination maybe yes it is oh I kind of get caught there we'll see if they chase I think there's a good chance they do they don't that's crazy now we need like we need to get back to this cash out here it's getting a little scary up we get him off the cash out I tried for the stun I'm not sure what happened we're going to use the frag here trying to just create chaos right now man another frag throwing it on the point just so they can't steal I'm just delaying we're playing the delay game again [Music] no I needed to get out of there but I bought enough time for my teammates to respawn oh we got wiped did they get it I think he might have sold by going for the res first come on yes we get it let's go we play the delay game perfect there again just stacking our utility dealing damage just being annoying that's really how you can still be effective on light even though the meta is kind of medium heavy there is still ways to use light effectively and just like you saw there with the nades the dash the invis it's so annoying to play against they were probably so annoyed that they couldn't just stick the point but it was that delay that we were able to apply now we're close to C so we can look for a play here I'm going to look for the invis stun play as always but this is I got detected so now we got to got to slow it down here can I break that I can okay we don't orange all right so purple and orange are here I saw somebody die but orange is full so it's orange and purple let's open up with a little nade in there try to deal some damage and we have pink we have everybody here got to be aware of this that dude was weak though so is this guy trying to get that kill my aim's a little rough there I'm going to keep it a buck this guy on the stairs can get him as well one left on pink po I think I heard somebody behind me get another one on pink that's a team WIP and we can wrap around here I want to keep looking to fight using the chaos to my Advantage I should res though I think I need to stick a res here I hope this is the medium on our team not the heavy I should have looked quicker it isn't that's fine I'll stick the res insta not a problem maybe my teammate could even stick this trying to get that kill getting lit up in the back my teammates weren't watching it for me little unfortunate but we're going to get a defib here so we're chilling popping invis on our teammates hide out in this corner here that guy's one HP trying to throw a nade behind me in case I do chase another one just in case we need to get back up to that cash out I'm going to reload the stun on my way up try to pop an invis as soon as I can here wait oh there's one to my right it's pink and purple but they're not really fighting each other they're just focusing us it's a little unluck there so the only thing I really could have done differently There Is Res the medium teammate first so he could used the defibrillator on the heavy and that would have bought us a little bit of extra time to maybe go for a steal uh and then just be able to play the delay game so little mistake by me there but it honestly might have cost us that cash out so something to be aware of in the future for sure we do have time here to get to cash out B and try to kind of contest this I saw somebody behind me but I'm going to hit this jump pad look for this elimination on the purple he took out Orange what's we got one orange left it's just the heavy oh I got another one spawning in behind me though and he's one HP or he's going to be half HP my teammates need to clean that up and go for the steel here they do they get the defim oh I'm out I don't have ammo no we're unable to get the point that's a that's tough man 8K damage 10 eliminations and that was a pretty tough tournament that last round there winning that would have been really difficult I thought we played really well to be honest maybe just a couple very small mistakes we could have changed that would have helped us uh get the dub there sometimes that's just how it's going to go especially when you're playing solo Q you got to be okay taking a loss here and there because as long as you're doing what you can that's all you can do so hopefully you guys enjoyed this video and it gave you kind of a look inside my mind as I'm playing and gave you some ideas of things you can Implement into your own gameplay when you guys are playing ranked thank you again so much for all the love and support on the last video it truly means so much to me that you guys have showed me so much love and I am so excited to be back pumping out finals content for you guys so again I hope you guys enjoyed this one as always I hope you guys have an amazing rest of your day

The Finals Season 4,LzdezFf4ENU,The Finals Did The IMPOSSIBLE...,the finals fourth season recently dropped in it is fantastic not only does it bring awesome new content to the game like these dual Desert Eagles and alternative weapon Optics but it really feels like the game has found its footing with Embark saying their player retention this season is fantastic which I guess actually makes the finals a successful free-to-play casual competitive FPS the finals is doing what seems impossible in today's market and I am all here for it all right so firstly if you haven't played the finals yet uh it's free to play and it doesn't have any pay to win mechanics and has some of the most epic destruction I've seen in a video game ever go try it no this is not a sponsored video with the recent launch of season 4 Embark just announced that it's been their most successful season so far with improved player retention and more positive feedback than Seasons the season brings of course a new map and new Cosmetics but it also added some highly requested quality of life gameplay features additional load out slots a proper static Crosshair tons of balance improvements and of course bug fixes the new map is called Fortune Stadium it's got a lot of elements from the soul map but condensed down into a slightly smaller playable area and more vibrant color coordination the launch Maps had more realistic paint and color schemes which made some areas kind of blend into others a bit but Fortune Stadium uses some pretty bold color palettes with areas having their own unique colors and some unique buildings it's definitely a solid map for gameplay but maybe not as interesting as say season 3's Kyoto map which leaned hard into Japanese Aesthetics with pagodas and foliage it seems like they might be planning on going back and forth between highly detailed Real World locations and then totally abstract wild map designs when it comes to gameplay the new map is absolutely fun it's not too small of a map but it actually feels bigger just because of how densely packed it is so you always have some good options for getting around and the combat flow feels spot on the new guns though are probably where the season shines the most the heavy gets a Kimbo 50 cal Desert Eagles which is a very finals weapon load out medium gets a DMR called The Pike 556 and light gets the M26 matter pump action shotgun now I've played around with the pike a bit and it hits surprisingly hard I can down a medium or light player in just a few shots and feel pretty confident against heavy this game doesn't have a giant arsenal of weapons but each one of them feels pretty iconic and fun to play with so I'm glad the devs are really taking their time with the weapon of roll outs and not overwhelming players now the season also adds some new attachments for the existing guns until now pretty much every gun in the game was naked meaning no weapon attachments like extended mags Optics grips or anything like that but this season adds a handful of Optics like red dots and low magnification Scopes to most of the guns the player base has expressed an interest in this sort of customization so it's nice to see Embark delivering it without mixing up the game's weapon balance or turning it into some sort of Hardcore gun customization FPS personally I like having a Red Dot site instead of iron sights on the akm it doesn't feel drastically different so I think I could perform just about the same with both of them but some maps do have darker areas and the iron sights don't silhouette as nicely on those and for that the Red Dot is just a nice Comfort to have you also get two additional load out slots to play with which definitely helps considering the growing arsenal of weapons and gadgets there's also a new sponsor system that expands the game's previous weekly challenges you can pick one of three sponsors to progress and unlock that sponsor's cosmetic items by completing the weekly challenges some of them can certainly make you play above or Beyond how you might typically approach the game like having a heal teammates for several thousand HP but you don't have to complete every single challenge you can just pick and choose which ones so usually there's a challenge in there that caters to your style more it is a little frustrating that you can't switch to a new sponsor at any time which means you're missing out on free Cosmetics from the other two sponsors even if you complete your chosen sponsor's progression before the season ends now when it comes to the smaller additions with this season there's a new static Crosshair setting that keeps the Crosshair fixed in the center of the screen which I know a lot of competitive players have been requesting as for balance changes Embark are working on evening out the win rates for all the classes the light class is currently the most popular pick with players and heavy is the least picked but the win rates are actually reversed with the light class players losing more games than Heavies so this season the heavy gadgets have been buffed a little while the RPG has been nerfed to be less of an opener or entry frag tool and I think the main issue with players picking the heavy less even though it has technically been a better class is just its lack of mobility in a game that's so focused on kind of parkouring your way around the map certainly slower moving suits the style of the heavy more but it's clear that players are gravitating towards the faster classes it would be cool to give the heavy some sort of Mobility option even if it didn't put it necessarily on par with the other class like a Hulk jump or something like that could be neat now I'm sure there's plenty of feedback and concerns about the game's balance overall but coming at it from more of the Casual perspective I didn't really feel like anything was too op this time around it also helps that the finals still feels like a casual competitive game where you can certainly take it seriously and have fun trying to win tournaments but it's also just about having fun and doing cool stuff like I've really enjoyed a bunch of the tournaments even that we've lost because some of the moments during the game play were so enjoyable now of course there's still some weaker items in the game that probably need some sort of buff to make more usable and then of course there's the whole meta of just throwing tons of Mines all over an objective which can be super frustrating but once you start to get the hang of it and figure out the meta it's not too hard to counter some of the more cheesy mechanics now there's a ton more changes with this season and the patch notes is like pages and pages so check those out if you're interested but circling back to how the game is doing overall could the finals join that elusive group of live service games that players tend to just enjoy more over time like hell divers 2 no man's Sky Path of Exile and Warframe though they might not be quite punching at those numbers just yet I could certainly see the finals becoming staple game for many Embark have done a great job of adding more stuff to the game while also not over complicated it so many games these days tend to balloon out once they hit some sort of success and it can make them less inviting to new players the devs seem to be keenly aware of this and even jumping back into season 4 it still feels just as fun and accessible as the first time I loaded up the game and they fixed one of my top complaints was just how grindy the battle pass felt especially since you were paying for it and now you can get through it pretty casually without having to think a ton of time into to it and the Cosmetics are still amazing so yeah I don't really think it's a surprise that the finals is doing so well they made something Innovative and fun that keeps getting more fun to play with every update what do you guys think though have you been pulled back into the finals and do you see the game standing the test of time let me know in the comments and if you enjoyed it don't forget to leave me a

The Finals Season 4,2yeLtejNKr0,The BEST and WORST Weapons in The Finals Season 4,here are the best and the worst weapons in the finals season 4 while I was I dropped my mouse where did it go while I Was preparing for the challenge stream that I had with fixie and dank D I figured that it was time to post a new tier list as well and of course as usual huge thanks to Embark for sponsoring this video if you guys want to check out season 4 links in the description let's dive into it starting off with light and the F tier we of course have to talk about the bow now I don't like the bow I know it was buff this season but I have a bone to pick with this thing I think it's just too inconsistent seeing it is a projectile weapon you still need to draw it and it's just not reliable enough when you compare to other weapons in this tier therefore again we're going to put the recurve bow and the F tier but I can definitely see people doing better with it and getting some value out of it if they want to play really flashy heading on into the E tier we going to start it off with the 93 R I know it was buffed this season and honestly yeah you can really feel it it definitely feels better than season 3 or even season 2 but it does still not really pack that much of a punch it is a burst weapon so maybe if you play around corners you can see some value but overall I feel like it just does not help me as a light I want to be able to go in and deal a lot of damage and get a kill and then get out rather than you know slowly plinking enemies down because if I keep plinking enemies down he's going to kill me eventually without me actually killing them so overall even though it was buffed it's easier to use now the sights feel a little bit better and of course the spread is better it just doesn't really hit home just yet which is why again I keep it into etier I never weapon into etier will remain there for the same reason maybe I am rating it too low but I kind of feel like it belongs here and that's the new weapon for a light and it's probably the only new weapon this season that I rate lowly and and of course it's going to be the M26 matter which is a decent gun in theory it can definitely put out a lot of damage however it's more of a sustained damage type of Deal or again you know darting in and out of corners but if you try to all in an enemy and try to get a kill on an enemy let alone a heavy or a medium you're going to die 99% of the time if you have M26 matter whereas if you use any more reliable weapons you probably would get the kill and the thing is that your lack of playing both in the open and one oneing both of the l3r on M26 matter so weapons that take a long time to kill somebody with is obviously bad for light but it's exacerbated by the fact that weapons like SE 40 is really dominating The Meta right now and the SE 40 will out DPS you if you get too close if you TR playing Corners the se40 will just kill you around the corner so you cannot win no matter what you do these guns are just not good enough and it's made even worse by The Meta so again in E tier you have both the 93r M26 matter as for the D tier we're going to started off with the dagger this might be a controversial opinion I know some people say that it's nerfed I guess they might be right it might be a bit slower hitting the alternate fire the back step with the dagger now but you can control it personally after a small adjustment period other than the speed I felt like I got more kills with a dagger now it was just so much easier going for trick stabs just jumping all over the place I just had more control of what I was doing and I believe that most users that weren't Die Hard dagger users probably see this as an overall buff because it is so much easier to actually perform with it it's more consistent sure you can't run and backstab that an entire enemy team in the back in a short span of time which you kind of already couldn't unless you got really lucky so yeah I still think it's pretty solid it just suffers from the same reason that light is suffering the same season and I just cannot rate it any higher than D I'd rather have a weapon in my hand another weapon in the D tier is going to be sh1 1900 which is solid it can one shot a light but again it's not really reliable enough in my opinion maybe it's a skill issue I don't like it you can two shot a medium and get that burst damage if you really try but it's just too much effort without enough of a reward and it's just not consistent enough in my opinion probably because of the screen shake that I want to rate anywhere higher than D so again in the D tier we're going to put the dagger and the sh1 1900 moving on into the C tier we're going to start that tier off with the sword now the sword actually saw some changes and it doesn't look like a lot on paper but once you play with it you can really feel like it feels a lot different the weapon is a lot more accurate now but obviously if you get used to the old accuracy it will take some time adjusting to I didn't manage to do that in time the lunge on your secondary ability has been raised from 5 me to 6 M or so but it feels like an entire Dash you just go flying in One Direction especially seeing as the lunge attack now maintains the top speed for slightly longer so it just feels like you're really flying or dashing forward when you're lunging it feels really good to use the sword and honestly maybe C tier is rating it too low but once you compare to the other weapons higher up in the list it will make sense another weapon in the C tier is going to be the throwing knives which now also saw a buff that you can just hold the right click and let go whenever you want it doesn't make that much of a difference for the throwing knives in my opinion maybe it's because when I was playing the throg knives I just made a habit of spamming right click and then eventually I would hit the enemy when it came around the corner or whatever I didn't really feel like it was a necessary addition it's a quality of lifing it's appreciated but it's still the throwing knives I feel like like you just don't really get to do much with them they deal a decent amount of damage but they're a projectile weapon and seeing as you're trading with heavy or medium again the whole Cal 40 problem or even the pike you're just going to die every single time if you're using the Frog knives they're just not amazing they're middle of the pack C tier is not amazing and closing out to C tier I'm going to put the v9s here I know it's a solid gun I would love to put it higher but I don't think that it has enough damage where it's worth it I know that jel can put a sight on the v9s and it feels really good especially with certain skins as you now can actually see what you're shooting at much more easily it's easier to track the enemy but compared to the other weapons which we'll get to in a little bit it has a semi-auto trigger so you need to keep spam clicking it the hip fire is not very reliable on it and the Damage isn't all that I don't have the updated numbers in front of me but I'm pretty sure it probably deals the same as like an M11 or a pre-nerf xp54 it's not insane it just doesn't make that much of a difference so again in the C tier we're going to place the sword the Frog knives and the be B NS all decent choices just a little bit on the troll side you probably better off using the following weapons instead so starting off the bti we have the lh1 now the lh1 is in a particular place I'm going to keep it in the B tier because it is a solid weapon especially now that you can put a sight on it but it still has gotten a indirect Nerf because of where the meta is heading again seal 40 or whatever or if you get to the longer ranges you're going to be playing as Pike users which we're going to cover in a little bit and you're just going to lose every time because the break point on a pike I believe a medium can kill a light with free shots but it takes I think four or five for a light to kill the medium back with the lh1 and it's just such a big difference in the time to kill that it's just not worth it using the lh1 if you're facing something like a pike which you probably will face all the time again it's definitely a buff maybe can use it as a single fire xp54 variant this season but overall it it works just not my biggest recommendation for light another weapon in the B is going to be the sr84 now this actually saw a Nerf because you now fire projectile shots past 4 met rather than just hit scan all the way but it's still a pretty good gun especially in a longer range meta I could argue that you have a better chance beating a medium with a pike by using a sr84 then you are with an lh1 because you can shoot once s 84 and if it's a heady they're going to have what 10 Health left you can just shoot them in a body or maybe they already were low enough in which case they're just going to die but lh1 exposes you for too long to actually give you proper value if you're trading with a long range fighter but that was that for the B tier again that's the lh1 and the sr84 going into the B tier hopping on into the a tier we have the xp54 which was my previous s tier pick it is a great gun I still think it's a great gun despite seeing a noticeable Nerf to its damage per second it lost two damage per bullet but seeing as it is a high fire rate weapon that makes a very huge dent in its damage per second over the course of a whole clip and you can really feel it when you're trying to fight for example a heavy or in some cases even a medium with good movement and it just doesn't feel the same it's still a solid gun I still felt like I was getting kills with it it's has very reliable and in my opinion pretty easy to control recoil pattern but it doesn't hit as hard so again that puts the XP 4 in the a tier and that brings us to the S tier for a light this season it stands out over the all even xp54 and that is the M11 which technically didn't even get a buff this season unless you count the reticle above which I guess it is so the M11 is the exact same has always been it's been pulling the valves strategy of doing absolutely nothing and having the cover guns just fall over face first and be useless it deals a solid amount of damage as we always have known it has a very good hip fire when it comes to spraying across most Rangers I think up to 5 or 10 m it's very accurate with the addition of the non-world Crosshair setting which makes your Crosshair in the middle of the screen static so it's easier to track an enemy when a lot of things are going around where the voice would jump around in addition to receiving a reticle which lets you aim down sight and actually see what you're shooting at just makes the M11 so good and seeing as xp54 which I believe had a higher DPS than M11 previously doesn't anymore there's really no reason to run anything else in M11 right now so if I would put any weapon in s for light I don't think light is in that of a healthy place at the moment but if I had to put one weapon in the s for light it's a pretty solid weapon and that's going to be the M11 moving on let's talk about medium who is seeing a massive stride to season so starting off going to start off with the F tier of all their weapons and it's really only one weapon here that I have to quickly mention and that is still going to be the dual blades I do not like them I've never liked them and probably never will they're like a riot shield but worse the deflect or the reflect is not reliable you still bleed health over time even if you're constantly holding it up and you're just going to die a lot as a medium using the dual blades it's like a riot shield which was my previous Le favorite weapon but way worse that was it for f tier so let's skip the E tier and we're going to talk about the D tier and of course that's going to be the riot shield again I don't like melee weapons in general I definitely don't like them on medium especially when they deal kind of consistent damage the thing is with the riot shield and even dual blades is that they do offer some protection indicates through the right Shield you have a big Square in front of you that bullets just will not go through whether you hold your Shield up or not it would just possibly do that there are some types of outplays that you can do with a right Shield when you combine it with different gadgets to get more value out of it and it was buffed this season but overall when you compare to actual weapons it's just going to fall short which is why the r Shield stays in a d tier hopping on over into the C tier we have the which received a buff this season you can out put a sight on it however at least in my opinion it is still not hitting as hard as it could or should and now that we have the pike which we will cover soon the Famas kind of doesn't have a place anymore it used to be a maybe mid to long range poking weapon and seeing as we were getting sights added to it a lot of people myself included thought it was poised to be the poking weapon for medium but it's just being power crap there's no reason to run the Famas at the moment which is why I put it in the C tier but popping on into the B tier we have two weapons the first one is a model 1887 I want to place this higher because it is an insanely good weapon in theur and on paper and in a lot of situations but when you're are fighting across the mid to Long ranges it's obviously going to be pretty useless you can pop off if you close a gap and you fight on a point absolutely but if you're fighting teams that is holding a position sitting up on high grounds and you shooting at you with seal 40s or shooting at you with Pikes there's not really much you can do with a model in hand you could make an argument it might belong in the eigh tier but I'm going to keep it in the B tier for now another weapon in the B tier is going to be the cl40 which was buff this season you can definitely feel it it's annoying as hell to fight against especially if you're playing light and in some cases medium because it's very little effort and it will let you get a lot of kills however it still only comes with four shots per magazine it still will be outdps by a lot of weapons in the game and if you have a high ground on a heal for the user they will deal no damage to you it's frustrating to play against it is much easier to use yourself and get maybe a Cheesy killer so so but it's just not reliable enough where I can place it any higher than the B tier so again that put some model and a c 40 in the B tier but moving on we have the a tier and that's going to start off with the akm now as of this season a tiny Nerf it now has 32 bullets instead of 35 you can feel it in some cases I will run into people that run out of ammo when they were one shot away from killing me so if you really use the magazines all the way through consistently it's going to be worse for you to season but you can now attach a sight to it which makes a massive difference and honestly I am more accurate with a sight and I can spare these free bullets as the trade-off is me hitting more than free bullets thanks to having an actual sight you know helping me to actually line up the shots correctly it is a consistent damage weapon pretty easy to control recoil and it just hits really hard another weapon in the a tier is going to be the F car I kind of wanted to move the F car maybe down to the B tier maybe akm would be upper a tier F car would be lower or maybe it's just kind of whichever you prefer because while the akm on paper should be better the F car still feels really good to use it almost feels better than the akm to use I don't know have to wear any undocumented changes or maybe I'm just so used to F card it feels better for me but I actually really like the F card season it hits hard it's consistent it comes with a site so it's up to you what you want to do and of course closing out the we have a weapon that I very much enjoy myself that is the revolver and this one probably benefits the most from a site out of all the weapons in this whole tier list out of in all classes really aiming with the iron sight with revolver used to be really awkward and was probably one of the main reasons that was holding it back from being as good as it could be but thanks to adding a sight to it this season you can now actually again you can see what you're shooting at it's much easier to Blink head shot and just pop off with it it hasn't seen any other Nerfs but this site alone just makes it a lot more relevant than a lot of other weapons it's also a decent weapon if you want to trade back against the medium to maybe even long range depending on how far that long range is so again in the a tier we're going to put the akm the F car and the revolver but then as for the S tier maybe the s+ tier overall if I would compare all the weapons in this game so far this one would take the cake by a long shot but very much intend that some people have disagreed with me on this but I'm going to stand by it and that's that the pike currently is the best gun in the finals and obviously for medium as well the pike hits incredibly hard across really long ranges the damage fall off doesn't seem to exist the scope is a bit awkward to use but it still hits really hard again it three shots are light in the body it's what two shots a medium double head shot and I believe double head shots one body shots are heavy so it shreds across all ranges it's very easy to use the magazine size is fine the only downside with the pike is that sure it has kind of a crappy hip fire and over closer ranges You could argue that it's awkward to use the scope if somebody's really close but all in all if you're accurate with your weapons the Pike's going to be insane it's so good it's maybe not as forgiving as a full auto weapon but again if you're just accurate I cannot see any better weapon this season and it's going to be a must have for me so again the pike goes into the S tier and finally let's talk about heavy starting off with the F tier we're going to have the mgl 32 which was buff this season it's not not enough still terrible Embark is promising a rework to the mgl in the near future or in the future and we're just going to have to wait and see what that entails if I could suggest something as some people who watch My Stream over at twitch.tv/ did ask you know what I would like to see to make it good and honestly if the mgl just exploded on impact with an enemy so it would still need to bounce two times to explode against props or whatever but again against an enemy or a shield instantly explode that would make a massive difference to how good the mgl 32 is because right now it's too consistent and unreliable and I haven't used it I don't know how much different it would be I don't know how the damage would feel but I think on its own that would make a massive difference in just how viable mgl 32 is but anyways that was it for the F tier we put the mg32 moving on into the E tier we have first off the spear which maybe we could have put farther down but it did receive a buff this season I am not a spear enjoyer i' say time and time again I'm not a melee enjoyer but the Run speed modifier during the secondary Spin Attack is now faster so you move a little bit faster as you doing the spin attack can still be decent if you catch enemies off guard or something but at the same time the mesh Shield was nerfed this season it's practically useless especially if you use it with certain types of weapons like melees where you kind of want to weave the shield in and out which to me means that the spear is in a really bad place this time maybe I would put it in the F tier but I feel like I still do better with a spear than I do with the mgl so we're just going to keep it there another weapon in the E tier is going to be the ks trree maybe I'm rating this too low sue me I don't think it's really that good it has some utility with you know it can destroy walls and whatnot but it doesn't really have that much damage it's not really that consistent as it fires a projectile and the Damage even if you do hit every shot doesn't really feel like it's all that maybe if you're just throwing suggestions out today I would love to see if the ks23 could head shot just as a maybe I would love to see what it feels like keep it difficult to use projectile weapon but reward that accuracy with head shots and depending on how impactful that would be it would probably feel like a c or B2 weapon just from that change alone putting it out there just saying so again that puts the spear and K free in the E tier hopping on into the D tier we have the flamethrower which also saw an indirect Nerf dis season because the Chang to mesh Shield which was a very important piece of the flamethrower kit even more so than the spear because weaving The Shield up and down and just kind of dowsing the enemies with a little bit of flames at a time was a valid Strat probably the main Strat for the flamethrower and again it doesn't work so that whole Strat is dead that being said I tried using the gravity Cube that was buff this season with the flamethrower and it felt really good thanks to the much larger range so there is some viability there you can still make it work with some other strats and it deals a decent amount of damage if you use it right definitely better than the spe the K three in my opinion which is why I put it in the D tier heading on into the C tier however we have the Sledge that's a great weapon I love the sledge so much best melee weapon in my opinion you could argue the sword is about the same but the Sledge provides more utility it can one shot you have these one shot Combos and it just has a higher impact especially as you're playing heavy which gives you more utility than I like either way that's just about heavy versus light more than anything but the Sledge just deals a lot of damage and is very reliable assuming you can close the gap so usually would want to run it with a winch claw again M Shield was nerfed less reliable but you can still make it work with the winch or even charge and slam if you feel like it though probably the winch makes more sense another weapon in the C tier that struggled a lot from the mes Shield Nerf and I keep I'm going to keep mentioning the mes Shield because I think that is the most impactful Nerf for heavy season it's going to be the sa26 you can still use the sa1 1216 with say a winch and get some value out of it especially because the animation canel still works but seeing as you no longer have a shield that you can put up and stay behind if you accidentally overextend or you bite off more than you can chew the S6 kind of ends up being an All or Nothing sort of weapon if you take a fight that you shouldn't have there's no getting out of it you're just going to die and be an easy target dead Shield really made a difference in that you can still use the shield and try to escape with it but then you're going to catch you it's not really that good but again closing out the C tier we have Sledge and SFL 16 hopping on into the B tier we have two weapons that honestly feel really good maybe I should even put them higher than this but we'll put them in the BT for now for the first of those two is going to be the luig gun which saw a change to its recoil pattern and it really feels really good now I was surprised to just how much of a difference the Lou gun had it still has that okay first few shots it you know it doesn't have much of a recoil and then it starts picking up much like a assault rifle but as of season 4 the whole recoil has been minimized I guess it still follows the same pattern but much less so and it just feels really good to shoot it I think if I can get used to shooting this thing I'm going to start beaming people across all ranges it deals ton of damage when used right so it's definitely worth considering the other weapon in the B tier is going to be the M60 which not only can be attached with a sight as of this patch but the fire rate has also been marginally increased so it ches a little bit faster deals a little bit more damage I feel like the M60 recoil pattern which also has changed it mostly works the same where you have a hard recoil at the first few shots and then it's very smooth even smoother now as you continue firing so you can just go full Rambo it basically comes down to whichever play style you prefer use with these two different lmgs having the site is a nice addition but personally I don't feel like it makes that much of a difference cuz I got used to the M60 sites I guess it block a large part of your screen but it weren't that much of a problem or as much of a problem as people made them out to be in my opinion if anything I feel weird using a side rather than the actual iron sights but that is the B tier again that's where we put the L gun and M60 and then moving on in the E tier we have a weapon that I'm having a hard time finding the perfect place for but I think going to settle it right here and that is addition to heavy to season the double deagles the double deagles can shred if you hit consistent head shot or use consistent shots with them they are nearly Unstoppable again with the inor Crosshair being turned off so it's F static that helps with aiming them a lot they do lose their accuracy over longer ranges there's some spread no matter whether you're aiming down sights or not and in my opinion over longer ranges they're just not consistent enough even though they deal a lot of damage when they do hit however if you take it to mid-range or close range the deagles hit insanely hard especially if you combine them with other utilities or other gadgets and if you're heavy fighting against another heavy most of the times the deagles should win because they Havey let's say they're using a l Gunner M60 they're going to be standing still and spraying at you and you can just easily plink them in the head and kill them nearly instantly again the only reason I can't put the deagles in the S tier is that they aren't accurate enough and I feel like it comes down to a lot of RNG or Randomness whether you hit your shots over the longer ranges and I'm not a fan of RNG G because whenever I trust RNG it lets me down and I will never advocate for that for a weapon being good if it has a lot of RNG maybe it's just a spray pattern and I suck what do I know but either way that was it for heavy with the deagle in the E tier a huge thank you guys for watching this video if you have any disagreements which I'm sure some people will have let me know in the comments and uh yeah I'll see you all next time peace out,"The text provided does not contain any information related to the CL-40 grenade launcher in the game 'The Finals'. The discussion is about the Recurve Bow and the 93 R weapons and how they performed in the game. Please provide more relevant information or context about the CL-40 grenade launcher so I could extract detailed opinions about it. The provided text doesn't contain any specific information or opinions about the CL-40 grenade launcher for the game 'The Finals'. It mainly discusses the M26 Matter, SE 40, and a dagger weapon, but no details about the CL-40 grenade launcher are given. Please provide relevant text or information for an accurate analysis. The reviewer has rated the CL-40 grenade launcher in the D tier. He feels that the weapon is not reliable enough and it's not consistently effective. According to him, it requires too much effort for little reward. Factors such as screen shake were also mentioned, which can affect the performance of the weapon. The reviewer mentioned the dagger and the sh1 1900 as other weapons in the same tier.

He then goes on to talk about the C tier weapons, starting with the sword, which has seen some changes. The reviewer acknowledges that it feels a lot different and more accurate now, particularly with the lunge on its secondary ability being increased. However, he feels that it might be rated too low in the C tier when compared to other weapons.

He also mentions the throwing knives, which have been buffed, but he doesn't feel this has made much difference. The reviewer says he has a habit of spamming the right-click function with this weapon and didn't feel the buff was a necessary addition. The user mentions the CL-40 grenade launcher as a problem in the game's weapon balancing, implying it's a key part of the current meta and possibly overpowered. However, they do not provide any specific details about the weapon itself. The user also criticizes the throwing knives for being a projectile weapon with decent damage, but considers them ineffective when compared to heavy or medium weapons like the CL-40 and Pike. They consider these knives as ""middle of the pack"" and not amazing. The user also mentions the v9s and feels it doesn't deal enough damage to be worth using, despite the ability to put a sight on it. They describe the weapon's semi-auto trigger and unreliable hip fire as negative aspects. The LH1 is considered a solid weapon, especially with the ability to attach a sight, but the user suggests it's indirectly nerfed due to the meta favoring other weapons like the CL-40 and Pike. The user doesn't provide any detailed opinions about the CL-40 grenade launcher, but their comments suggest it may be too powerful in the current meta. The text doesn't provide any specific details or opinions about the CL-40 grenade launcher for the game 'The Finals'. It mainly discusses the lh1, pike, sr84, xp54, and M11 weapons. It would be helpful to provide information specifically about the CL-40 grenade launcher for more accurate analysis. The comment points out some strengths and weaknesses of different weapons in the game 'The Finals'. The M11 is highlighted for its accuracy at short range (up to 5-10m), and the addition of a static reticle has improved tracking enemies in chaotic situations. The commentator also notes that the M11 now seems to outperform the XP54 in terms of DPS, making it their weapon of choice in the light category. However, they express some dissatisfaction with the current balance in the light class.

The commenter then moves on to the medium class, expressing a strong dislike for the dual blades, which they compare unfavorably to the riot shield. They note that the deflection mechanism is unreliable, and the gradual health drain even when holding up the shield makes survival difficult. The riot shield is also mentioned as a disliked weapon due to its melee nature, suggesting the player prefers ranged combat. 

However, no specific opinions about the CL-40 grenade launcher are mentioned in this excerpt. Players' opinion on the CL-40 grenade launcher in 'The Finals' game appear to be mixed. The weapon has recently been buffed, which players definitely noticed and appreciated. Many found it annoying to fight against, indicating that it could be disruptive and challenging in combat. However, it is not ranked among the top weapons, as it is placed in the B tier. This suggests that while the CL-40 grenade launcher may have improved, it is still not considered one of the most effective or preferable weapons in the game. It appears to be more effective in certain situations, but not consistently so across varied scenarios. As for weapon balancing, there's a suggestion that some weapons are being ""power crept"", meaning they are overshadowed by newer, more powerful weapons, which could be an indication of imbalance. The CL-40 grenade launcher in 'The Finals' has garnered mixed opinions, particularly among players who prefer light and medium classes. The weapon is praised for its ease of use and ability to get kills with minimal effort, making it particularly appealing for players looking for a quick win. However, its limitations are also noted, with only four shots per magazine and a lower overall damage per second (DPS) compared to many other weapons in the game. In situations where the enemy has the high ground, the CL-40 fails to deliver any damage. Users find playing against this weapon frustrating, and although it provides a somewhat 'cheesy' kill, it's not considered reliable enough to rank higher than the B tier.

Moving on to the A tier weapons, the AKM has received a slight nerf this season, reducing its magazine from 35 to 32 bullets. Players have felt this change in gameplay, often running out of ammo just one shot away from a kill. However, the new ability to attach a sight is a major advantage, improving accuracy and more than compensating for the loss of the three bullets. The AKM has a consistent damage output, easy-to-control recoil, and hits hard.

The F Car, another A tier weapon, has also been discussed. There's some debate about whether it should be moved down to B tier, with the AKM appearing superior on paper. However, many players find the F Car more enjoyable to use, feeling it hits hard, is The text doesn't provide information regarding the CL-40 grenade launcher for the game 'The Finals'. Please provide specific details about the weapon so that I can analyze it. The user talks about various weapons, but the CL-40 grenade launcher is not specifically mentioned. However, the user does provide feedback on the MGL 32 grenade launcher, stating that it is currently in the F tier, meaning it is considered to be a low performing weapon. The player suggests that it is inconsistent and unreliable, even after being buffed this season. They suggest a fix for the MGL 32 which would be to have it explode on impact with an enemy, which they believe would significantly improve its viability. The user also mentions that they are awaiting a rework from the game developers, Embark, which they hope will improve the weapon. The user seems to have a few issues with the CL-40 grenade launcher. They mention that the weapon can destroy walls, but its damage output is not consistent or high enough. Despite landing every shot, the user doesn't feel that the damage is significant enough. They suggest that the weapon could be improved by allowing it to head shot, which would make it a more high-risk, high-reward option, potentially elevating its perceived effectiveness.

They also mention other weapons in the game, such as the ks23, the spear, the K free, the flamethrower, and the Sledge. The flamethrower was identified as having an indirect nerf due to changes to the mesh Shield, which was a key part of its strategy. However, the user found that pairing the flamethrower with the buffed gravity Cube made it more viable.

The Sledge was praised as the best melee weapon in the game, for its high damage and utility. The user suggests that it could provide more utility when playing as a heavy class. The player feels that the CL-40 grenade launcher is a reliable weapon provided they are able to close the gap to their enemies. They believe combining this weapon with a winch claw is a good strategy. However, they also feel that the nerf to the M Shield has made this weapon less effective, but it can still work with the right strategy.

They compare the CL-40 grenade launcher to the SA26 and the S6 weapons. The SA26 also struggles from the M Shield nerf, but can be useful if used with a winch. The S6, on the other hand, is seen as an ""all or nothing"" weapon due to the lack of a shield for protection.

In contrast, they have positive opinions about the luig gun, stating that it feels really good after changes to its recoil pattern. They were surprised at how much of a difference the update made, and believe it deals a ton of damage when used correctly.

Overall, the player seems to have mixed feelings about the weapon balance in 'The Finals'. They appreciate the changes to some weapons, but feel that the nerf to the M Shield has negatively impacted the usability of others.

The Finals best weapons season 3,Uqi7kKJPxMs,The BEST And WORST Weapons in The Finals Season 3,okay chat so we're going to be doing a tier list if you guys have been wondering what weapons to use in the finals season 3 look no far we've spent the last Almost 12 hours playing every single weapon and trying them out and I feel like I have a good grasp of what you should be running if you guys don't know who I am I'm otter I'm the guy to when it comes to guide and educational content when it comes to the finals uh on YouTube and I spent a lot of time just dissecting this game and learning about the game and we have Sol a diamond countless of times so you know when you if you want if you want some extra credentials there you go you're also live on Twitch right now so if you guys are so Chad will actually be able to give me their thoughts on my tier list as we are going through it and maybe Chad disagrees and then we'll have some live feedback as well but let's talk about it but let's yeah I'm still sick but let's talk about it we have a lot of things to go through we're going to start with light so okay let's talk about light I have ridden all of it down here because it took a while so light got the fmal board this season and it got the bow we're going to talk about both because there are some implications here about how they work for light and how to enable light's kit um but starting off we're going to obviously say the MP5 the xp54 it is still goated it has I believe maybe the best damage we're going to get to that later but it's certainly very easy to control it has a good sight you can combine it with cloak you can go out of cloak and into you can go out of cloak and start shooting much faster thanks to the scope which helps you stay uh keep your aim On Target is is very it's very easy to control the recoil so I would have to put it in easily I'm going to put the xp54 in s tier easily just starting off the list it has to go into the S tier following up with that I was very surprised to hear about the lh1 Buffs they seemed a little bit out of the blue and once I played it I'm going to say it's over buffed it's super easy to to use it shreds everything so fast across all ranges it three Taps a uh light uh four taps a medium and I think it's like six taps or seven Taps of heavy if it's all bodies if you hit a heav it's like one tab less cuz it's a 2X modifier it is super easy to control thanks to the change to The Recoil and visual recoil it is an absolute goat I'm not sure whether I would say it's better than the xp54 this season but I will tell you it is certainly up in s here extremely good might actually be better because you can engage from all ranges if you play terminal attack or if you play uh World Tour Quick Cash you just [Â __Â ] shoot people from Super far away and they're just going to turn into easy kills you think it's a tier I think personally it's it's s tier both s uh MP5 and LH one I would put in the S tier as for the 93r it's one of the worst weapons for light or has beenin but they did buff it this season it shoots I believe it has better range tighter spread and I believe that's it I don't think they touch the damage really it feels easier to use and I definitely felt like I could do more with it over longer ranges even hipfire felt a little bit better thanks to the tighter spread but overall it's still a burst weapon and they even said in the patch notes that they want burst weapons to be for landing head shot but we never really landed any like you don't really land head shots in the finals especially with first weapons are even automatics consistently enough where play for it and if I feel like if you do go for head shots you need a higher headshot modifier instead of the very low headshot modifier we have right now so 93r feels better I don't remember exactly where we had it last season but I'm going to put the 93r in the C tier maybe I would even put it closer to the D tier somewhere in between um but definitely like low C tier actually looking at the list I'm going to put in the D tier after all I don't remember what we had last season but that had to go down a little bit we made some I said we're going to make some adjustments on stream as we go through this so that's one we're going to move down uh moving on we have v9s V n s is slightly better it's one more damage as far as I know I don't think that adjusts the time to kill or shots to kill significantly on any class um the main problem with the vs was never is damage I believe in theory it has one of the highest DPSS if not the highest DPS is in the game the problem has always been that the sights are terrible I believe it probably needs the type of buff that lh1 received where the animation is different it doesn't slap you in the face as you try shooting but but overall I would say that it's not really that much different this season uh viability wise and I'm we're going to put it in the B tier because it's still solid it's just really hard to use I will have to say also yeah somebody just said your Logitech code isn't working if you use the Logitech code in my description you will get 10% off it's already automatically applied if you use the link in the description that's probably why the code isn't working thank you for using it though okay so moving on we have the sh1 1900 and this thing has gotten they buffed it hard this thing is so good now it used to be in the bottom one of the worst weapons right now um or last season it was one of the worst weapons last season the H 1900 and now it one shots a light two pumps of medium and two pumps of heavy if you get close enough and it hits so hard it might even be meta again a cloak feels pretty solid with it because run Dash with it doesn't really matter uh I would say that it works not only for quick cach but if you would be playing terminal attack it's super good for opening damage cuz you need burst damage to kill somebody with but if you manage to stay alive until the final ends of terminal attack when everyone is 100 health or so having the shotgun is going to be Paramount because you can just jump in and one shot everyone it's extremely good for that reason alone uh we're going to have to put the sh1 1900 in oh I didn't even put in a tier yet I'm putting it in the a tier I don't know why I didn't put anywhere but I'm going to put it in a tier definitely um I it could almost be S tier but but it is a shotgun so it has a bit of a it doesn't have much range and that lack of viability and it doesn't compare to the MP5 L1 uh lacking that viability just just pales in comparison sadly Al if you guys enjoy all the gameplay in the background which we're showing on the not on stream but uh on the video that we're uploading you guys should definitely subscribe to OT gameplay I'll link it in the in the description if you want to check it out we're going to be posting individual like the best games we got today we're going to be posting on a channel you can check it out we post uh several times a day or once a day at least moving on we've talked about 9R v9s and Sh 1900 now we're going to move on to the next one which is the M11 so M11 hasn't received any changes so this is going to be fast it has overall decent hip fire and it's pretty good for Jewels if you play against a lot of lights if you play against a light who is on the xp54 um they're going to be or even the lh1 they're going to be slow down ads and you will have an upper hand being able to hip fire on around closer ranges and just out DPS him because it's a good hitfire gun for that spread and a large magazine overall though it doesn't really outperform those weapons which is why the M11 in my opinion goes into the E tier oh I forgot to write this one down as well my bad next up we have the sniper this one is going to be a bit difficult because I'm really biased you guys know I really like the sniper it's really fun to use it has a massive uh roof where it comes to skill expression a pretty high floor as well but it is very it can be very impactful it can be very useless you can use a close range but obviously we're going to assume you just use it for Mid and close range uh it is a a hit scan high damage weapon very good for dealing chip damage in most modes but it is the strongest in ranked ta because you can just sit back and deal chip damage without being traded back uh by the enemy team the lh1 is more versatile but the sniper is still the goat when it comes to just dealing a lot of Chip damage on enemy team and then being able to one shot everyone with body shots once late game comes in I want to say that the SR 94 though because it isn't super viable in cash out in close range in these really chaotic fight especially around the cash out as are being claimed um I have to put it in the B tier at the highest can you bring up the weapons as you R review them no we're doing a video as well there will be gameplay in the background when we are reviewing them but right now we can't have the gameplay running so you can just close your eyes and just enjoy the sound of my voice um dagger as for the dagger it's actually worse this season it didn't really get nerfed or anything it's just that the meta surrounding the game I feel like kind of punishes dagger a lot and there's a lot of melee weapons that just punishes the dagger because dagger will lose against other melee weapons if you get into a because if you if you're if two persons if two people are meleeing they're going to be punching each other and you're never going to be able to go for backstabs I managed to get some backstabs when I played with it but that's cuz I got lucky usually you're just going to get slapped around by the hundreds of different melee weapons and out DPS uh because the left click isn't super good compared to the other melee weapons in the game I'm going to put the dagger in the I forgot to write it down great I'm going to put it in the E tier because again I think it's been bumped down a little bit you can still make something fun happen with it but as far as like getting you wins or having any impact in the game it's it's not there anymore it never really was before but it definitely wasn't now it's worth mentioning that all melee have multi-hits now so if you and this will apply to sword which we're going to talk about in a second where as long as enemies are within your hitbox when you're dealing damage they will take damage I think that's very good um but it will take some time or so but that I place every weapon including the dagger so it's yeah not super good moving on sword emote cancels as you guys know are gone thank God for that we're happy to see it um obviously you can still quick swap as I understand it you can Phantom strike as I understand it I don't know if those are banable emote cancels War um don't recommend doing it I tried using the sword without any exploits or cancels I still did fine with it but and I feel like it's the type of weapon where you can kind of you can kind of carry with it in the right Lobby and with the right play style but once you start playing against people who pay attention to what they're doing once the level of play goes up the viability with the sword drastically goes down so I'm going to put it into C tier and you guys are going to hear some notifications cuz I have a delivery another one missed it this time I missed it last time uh that was a sword as for throwing knives so in short as I understand the changes left click so the main primary fire has been nerfed and the right click has been buffed uh the power sort of shifted from being a left click spammer to right to where right click also is kind of viable it has a longer range and goes faster when you right click uh so it's better to snipe with it and you can kind of like work with both if an enemy is far away you want to go for right click if they're a bit closer you want to go for left click it's nice to have both of the options but I want to say it's overall a Nerf because just having left click available was just way easier and I feel like if it's something is easy then it's clearly good right so I'm going to say it's overall a NERF with throwing knives and I'm going to put them in actually forgot to put them down um I probably want them somewhere between B tier and a tier they're very annoying to deal with but are not super viable against super swey teams I want to say so I'm going to put them in B tier and I'm saying that as somebody who has ran a lot of frog knives maybe I'll bump them up later down the time down the line but so far frog knives are going to be at the upper beat Tier we haven't done we're doing light medium and then heavy we have not done the others yet um okay so last one for light is of course the bow bow is I'm torn on bow I feel like maybe I need to use it more to get like a super good opinion on it but from my experience in the preview and from using it now is it's a little bit clunky I learned how to get around the clunkiness of it I learned how to use it more efficiently but I still felt like against most meta weapons it wasn't super good I did feel outclass in most situations in close range and mid-range and I definitely felt outclass at super long range let's say I'm fighting at s or 98 or something 84 or something it's it's hit scan with a scope versus just a a projectile bow that you need to charge up you're just going become a very easy target um you can run light with Dash it can be really fun to use it and you can get some really fun Clips um but I don't think it has let's say like high ranked viability I might end up eating my words on this and when I say high ranked I mean like world like Cash Out World to not ta it's even less viable in ta probably um but I'm just saying like in general I feel like against good players that are playing compositions meta compositions and then meta was I I just don't feel like the bow provides any value it's basically I feel like there's a lot of overlap with the throwing knives and the bow U not just because the both are projectile weapons but because they're kind of gimmicky and overall they kind of just don't provide it's a projectile weapon too but it just doesn't provide consistent damage you can really rely on them no matter who you are even if you're the best bow person in the world you're going to you're not going to be able to rely on him what's my favorite weapon for light uh I lh1 definitely I'd say yes I'm still in the skypad use code get 10% off it's great but that was all a light um we'll have the thing on the screen I think once uh thrill starts editing but we're going to hop on over to medium I'm going to give you guys my thoughts on medium I played a lot of light but medium is very interesting I feel like cuz there are a lot of changes to the weapons in medium and I feel like there's been a little bit of a shuffle here so we're just going to go over it f car overall it I don't think anything has changed so it is going to perform the same and that's still kind of at the top of the list I personally use akm more than the F car so I'm going to be biased towards akm but I mean yeah no F car is unchanged and I'm going to have to put the F car in the S tier because it is still the best allround weapon in the game and you have a scope on it which helps you like hit head shot and just hit beams with it the recoil is annoying to use but or annoying to compensate for and it feels like shoots marshmallows compared to the previous one but I didn't it changed the season so I can't really complain akm is also pretty decent did not see any changes again it's kind of like what do you feel like having uh but I also wouldl the akm in the S tier it deals a good amount of damage it's solid damage just a larger larger magazine and easier vle control so if you don't want the magazine and I believe the damage is still about the same um if you don't care too much about a scope I still think akm is a better choice but it's all personal preference of anything um as for the akm fire rate was increased was it this season that can't be right you're wait so what are the new what are the new numbers then no you're you're fooling me they did not change the akm don't you try pulling a fast one on me again I will get you next time all right moving on so what about uh Famas the Famas Now deals I believe it's better over range is a bit tighter but overall I feel like it definitely is better than the 93r and it does what they want to do with like having burst tighter they want you want to get head shots or whatever but I feel like when you record and it when you use the M of a range it kind of feels okay but personally I I didn't feel like it was any good once the range started closing towards medium range or even close range at that point I would rather just use anything else like the akm or the F car and those are still viable all-rounders to poke enemies at really far range anyways so I don't think think that a I don't think that the Famas is that valuable I'm going to put the Famas in the B tier as for the C 40 we are seeing some Buffs to it as well doesn't make it vable we will see it shoots faster this season you deal less self damage but overall I feel like it just doesn't feel that good to use I it's still a projectile weapon so you can they can counter with APS at least a little bit it doesn't deal too much damage unless you direct hit with it and it just just doesn't feel good I I will always hit on projectile weapons and this one is also a splash damage weapon which means that it's just too risky to use it you're not going to have consistent damage which is the most important part of uh a weapon so I will put a seal 40 in C tier revolver has been unchanged we thought there was a change CU it felt different in the preview maybe it was different in the preview but in the live version it is not I'd say that it's kind of awkward to use against the other meta weapons but it can still shine in the right hands it still has a decent chunk of damage it still has a 2X multiplier uh and with the Cur meta I can see it being okay I'll see it being okay especially like let's say you're Ching you can CH lights with the lh1 for example it basically is in a way the lh1 for medium not as strong but sort of the same anyways um you can still shoot back at that range and be able to trade with them so definitely I would say that the it's it's not you can't compare it to the S tier or the a tier but I feel like it belongs just finding the B tier and uh we're just going to move on from there with the model 87 it's also unchanged if anything if anything the surrounding meta assuming people are playing a lot of melee it is a little bit buffed but I don't know whether melee will stick around or not that being said model is good for carrying you can use it in both termal attack and quick cach type of game modes or cash out type of game modes um for very high burst damage two typ of light sorry one type of light if you get really close and meat shot I believe or two type of medium and you can pull out a lot of clutches that with a very high amount of burst damage that no other weapon in the medium kit really has except maybe the revolver but not really um so I actually want to put the model above the revolver and the Famas because of the clutch potential sure you don't have any range but if you close the range you can just burst so much damage um that no other weapon really can compare moving on moving on this is like a whole presentation I even have the my computer a little laptop here with the notes so I don't forget foret duel swords chat personally I feel like duel swords they feel better than the riot shield which we will get to later they are fun to play they are fun to play if you play against stuff like bow or single fire weapons um maybe even a shotgun or the sniper but when you play against fully automatic weapons if the enemy knows you're coming they're completely useless they are fun and gimmicky um but as far as you know pulling it up against actual good players who knows what you're doing that you're coming and are positioning in ways where you can't close the gap there's not much you can do I feel like the J katanas can let you stall out a fight due to the deflect uh because nobody will shoot into the deflect once they know what it does most people don't know at the moment um because I've seen so many people just kill themselves shooting into dual swords but I I will say that overall stalling a fight isn't good for you or the person you are fighting you're just inviting third parties uh you don't really have much of an impact in the fight it comes down to what the enemies are doing instead personally I would say the double katanas are very overrated if anything uh and I will put them in E tier only because I don't want to put them in the riot shield uh which we'll get to now um I'm going to say that riot shield is probably the worst weapon in the game or second to worst weapon in the game it's definitely the worst melee um and it's even worse this season because they didn't buff it and they didn't add anything to medium but they added more melees and if think is riot shield immediately falls short riot shield is all about countering um it's all about countering like weapons like guns but it gets countered by almost every gun in the game flamethrower shoot straight through it uh all melees go straight through it and you know we got two new Mele melee weapons this season which means that they're just going to this just more things that are going to counter riot shield out of there the winch claw which is meta counters the riot shield because it also just hooks you in uh the only good thing with the r Shield is that yes you can kind of block enemies block shots like with the dual swords but people can shoot your feet and kill you anyways dual swords at least can block your the entire front apparently at least when I tested it they're fun but they're not like good and I think R Shield is is really really really bad in general one the only redeemable quality I can give to R Shield is that when you're swinging you can turn your side sighted towards the enemy in which case your Shield will passively eat some shots um but overall it's just not good again probably one of the worst weapons in the game it is absolutely terrible i've been saying that for fre seasons and I will say it again this one it is not good I am I am a if I am a right Shield hater if all if if there are no right Shield haters then I am dead Okay moving on so then we have one more class and this one is also like I said very big I don't have all the numbers at the moment for to change to heavy and weapons but we can still class them based on how they performed which I think is more important than knowing what numbers are cuz the numbers won't change how they perform so first off revolver is now s here F an animation pack I do have to add that absolutely I love the revolver r a lot I love this one so much but absolutely yeah moving on heavy M60 so what I did with the M60 and we're going to get to l g in a second is that the initial kick of the M60 has changed um where you have a really rough kick for the first five or 10 bullets like it it's really really hard recoil and then there's like nearly no no recoil for the rest of your 70 magaz 70 bu magazine um so it's an interesting tradeoff I would say that it took a while to get used to I still haven't gotten fully used to it but you can just as soon as you got past that initial hump and recoil you can just spray everything down it is super easy and it's it you really turn into Rambo just pop down a shield or play from good position and you put a lot of damage out on people uh sure the damage fall off isn't the best but I feel like that's offset by the fact that there's nearly no recoil but if you get close enough to the enemy you can just kill everyone you will just kill everyone Bey Kirk thank you so much for the twitch Prime as for the Lou gun I feel I never really like the L gun that much and the change that they made now oh yeah also the damage is lower with the M60 and the L gun um I felt it definitely felt like it did less damage but it wasn't the worst on M60 cuz you just have so many bullets and it was so easy to control it as for the Lou gun I feel like it still doesn't feel good for me personally not only is there a high recoil but the recoil is very has a lot of horizontal recoil it jumps a lot to the left and right um but the lus gun has the opposite of M60 with the recoil there is absolutely or almost no recoil for the first maybe five 10 bullets and then it gets super aggressive recoil wise for the rest of the pattern it actually I believe ramps up even more the more you shoot your magazine it has a smaller magazine but it's clear that they want kind of like they want to be a burst weapon if anything uh I forgot to rank the M60 sorry M60 are put an a TI probably as for the uh Lou gun though yeah just like when you shoot over a long period of time it just stops being viable which is kind of weird for heavy because with heavy at least in my opinion because I play M60 you're supposed to be inside of the enemy team or like on the front line you might be playing the shields or whatever and just putting out a lot of pressure and damage and it's hard to do that with the Lou gun because you can't keep shooting for the entire magazine you keep having to pause and get that recoil reset before you continue um this is probably some personal preference but I feel like due to how I believe heavy should be played I want to say that Lou gun is worse than the M60 actually a tier below I think I forgot to put it down there but it is in the I'm going to put the luig gun in the B tier when the M60 is in a tier in my opinion fun doesn't equal strong guys in ranked exactly very important distinction when now personally I think winning is fun so to me I weapon being good means it is fun but it is not a factor we can go by we need to go by like how good is this how viable is this weapon to to get me a win that's what I care about when we when I do a tier list or a lot of kills which usually goes hand in hand uh moving on we have the mgl 32 I feel like the stealth bu this but I haven't used it enough to know for sure it still sucks though probably again definitely the worst gun in the game um I don't know which one is worse the mgl or the riot shield is really a mid off uh it just doesn't really deal damage to it doesn't consistent damage because you need to bounce one pill and then have it hit an enemy the amount of damage it deals isn't that much I guess it does like a lot of Clump damage um if there's a lot of people bunched up but that's about it it doesn't much destructive damage so it doesn't really have much of an impact on the game or on the map and it doesn't really do much when it comes to like so basically the the ideal way to use a mgl is if a full team is in sitting on a high ground and they're just fully encamped and just lob a bunch of grenades in there but if an enemy is close especially if they're close to you it immediately sucks in my opinion and you take a lot of self damage from it too uh I tried using it with the winch claw which just pulls the enemy close it lets me line up one or even two grenade shots but the amount of damage I took both from the mgl and then just dealing more damage because your gun deals more damage made it not worth it mgl is good for flushing out room but that's all about it can do yes and is not consistent d damage which I again believe is very important sorry I forgot to rank that uh I'm putting the it's a it's a f tier mgl is an F tier I don't know if I even needed to say that flamethrower flamethrower is not very good especially on Kyoto because there's a lot of high grounds and far ranges it's hard to reach to enemy so I never really got to use it properly it's a bit more solid on let's say Monaco because you play inside if you can play inside of a normal house or building as in like a Monaco building which which pretty small room you can make the flamethrower work because enemies going to be panicking and it can't really shoot back but in the open is absolutely useless it doesn't deal a lot of damage I thought it would synergize with the winch where you pull the enemy in because of close range but it deals so little damage that I would just winch them inside start shooting them and it would either just kill me uh with the flamethrower would just kill me or they would run away and I couldn't catch up cuz I was shooting with a flamethrower so overall not very good then again I may just bad with the flamethrower I don't know but I'm going to put the flamethrower in the E tier because it's still believe it is better than for example the mgl it's just not good at all uh as for the ks23 I believe it has actually received a buff this season it has a higher DPS it has a faster was it like the pump action I think it said um but honestly in my opinion it is still not that good it is a hip fire not a hip fire it is a projectile weapon so it doesn't deal a lot of damage over it just doesn't de consistent damage you need to lead every shot you do especially over range there even damage follow and whatever I tried running it with winch because I know there's some decent comments you can get off of it but it was really hard to even hit the shots on enemies when they're close because they started jumping around and you have to predict how you want to use the Kos R three and it's hard to predict it maybe if I had more experience with the winch and the ks I would do better but overall I don't feel like it is a lot more viable this season because it is still again projectile weapon um KS is probably decent intermal attack speaking of which because it does have um the a little bit of burst but you can kind of peak the a little bit damage and then like get it back into cover so they can't shoot you back uh but overall I wouldn't say and I believe it does enough damage to one shot somebody if have 100 Health don't remember exactly but I would say oh no it doesn't it doesn't at all but I would say it's not that good sa 1216 definitely more viable this season we thought that they buffed it when we played it in the preview events because it felt like it de more damage or even shot faster but apparently somebody compared it it it wasn't stealth buff or anything it's the same but it synergized is pretty well with the winch which makes it better than in the last season and it even helps with melee and Etc I don't know why I said that but you don't last part but as soon as I say over the winch you get up close a lot of people are really close this season I feel like every really far away or really close especially all the melee a lot of people want to push uh Force melee on you and since they for these close ranges you can just out trade them with s26 again if you soon J with the winch getting close enough you can follow it up by shooting him going bum bum bum and they're gone I'm going to put the s26 in in the B tier so right next to the Lewis it is a bit Niche cuz you lack range you need a team that plays with you and enables you you need a team that shoots over mid to Long ranges to make up for your like of range if you don't have that it's going to be very bad but if you do pull if you use it in the right environment I can actually see being pretty solid uh moving on I actually had the most fun with this one this was the sledgehammer super fun to play with it's pretty decent it's perfect for the winch there's one-hot combos for medium and light where if you for example if if if you hook a light you use winch hit your mouse one look to the side so it hits faster and then punch and for medium you winch right click and then punch so not only do you not need to close the gap and also they changed the slide at the end of last season and they added multi- hits to the sledgehammer uh as of last season it's pretty overloaded it's just a lot of different ways you can kill people right now uh with it but not only do you have ways to kill people once you get close you can just pull them to you thanks to the winch super fun to play with right now super fun uh and also pretty solid and I'm going to put the sledgehammer in the C tier with the k23 maybe it even deserves to be higher but I feel like again you start using if you try using the sledgehammer against like a serious team I feel like they're just going to un even if you go it you might pull off occasionally but overall they're just going to kite you and kill you and finally we're going to talk about the spear that's heaviest new weapon this season it has basically just kind of poke at them with the spear and you have a right click which does like AOE damage and you can push the you can push the cash out and stuff away and it for some reason doesn't always work did you guys get the clip of the spin by the way I think you did right uh we had this we went for the spin we went into the whole enemy team and it didn't do the damage so it's not very reliable I'm not sure how it's supposed to work but clearly it didn't overall though I would say that I don't know the exact damage but you don't have the same one shot combos that you have your sledgehammer and and winch it doesn't have any destruction it's all about damage it has a longer range so it's more forgiving with the winch you can double you winch double spear a light and they die and you kind of like just jump around and spear someone but overall it didn't feel that good to use it didn't feel like it really had that much of a damage or stickiness or anything like that we clipped it okay thank you I hate that the spear only does 65 damage in the first hit but 75 over two that is that is stupid as hell yeah okay so apparently does 65 damage on the first set and 75 on the other two that feels really weird um it has a lot of gimmicks to it is not reliable damage it is very bad as far as melees go and for the first time probably ever we have found a weapon that will join the mgl 32 in the F tier because I will play a spear in the F tier as well if you want a melee on heavy just play the sledgehammer it's more fun it has destruction and one shot combos with the Winch just use the sledgehammer instead bit disappointed that all the new weapons plays pretty low overall in the ti um I don't know what you guys in chat think but I personally would love if we had if they would start adding weapons that are more like you know B tier a tier maybe even s tier instead obviously we don't want them to be overpowered but we I want some actual competitors I don't want another season of weapons just being mid um I don't know why they keep doing that they in season two and doing season 3 uh either way guys that was all for the tier list the stream continues don't click out but that was it for the tier list if you guys have comments make sure to drop them in the comments if you guys enjoyed the video hit the like subscribe going to be uploading a lot of content for the finals now with the upcoming season I'm going to be a dream hack if you guys are going to dream hack use cod a 15% off um but I'll be making sure to get as many videos as many videos out as possible until dream hack starts and even afterwards we're just going to have a small yeah we're 12 hours in on the stream right now but that's it for the ti list uh I'm going to hop back into gaming and uh yeah I'll see you next time ow bye-bye,"The speaker, Otter, is a seasoned player of 'The Finals' and is well-respected for his guide and educational content on YouTube. He has played the game extensively and has reached the diamond rank multiple times. In this discussion, he is giving his opinions on weapon balancing and discussing his weapon tier list for season 3. 

Starting with the light class, Otter mentions the MP5 and the XP54, which he believes to be among the best weapons in the game due to their high damage and ease of control. The XP54, in particular, is praised for its good sight and compatibility with the cloak ability, which allows players to quickly transition from stealth to combat. He rates the XP54 as an S-tier weapon.

Otter then starts to discuss the LH1 Buffs, but his thoughts are cut off before he can provide any detailed opinions. However, from his surprise in hearing about the buffs, it can be inferred that he did not expect the LH1 to receive any enhancements.

However, Otter does not provide any detailed opinions about the CL-40 grenade launcher in this particular excerpt, so we cannot analyze his views on this weapon. The player feels that the CL-40 grenade launcher is overpowered following a recent buff. This is because it is simple to use, kills opponents across all ranges quickly, and is able to effectively damage all classes of player (light, medium and heavy). The player specifically mentions that it is able to kill a light class in three hits, a medium in four, and a heavy in six or seven if all shots hit the body. The player also compliments the changes to the weapon's recoil and visual recoil, which make it easier to control.

The user indicates that the CL-40 grenade launcher is a top-tier weapon, ranking it in the S tier alongside the MP5 and LH1. The player feels that the CL-40 may be superior to the XP54 this season, particularly in certain game modes like Terminal Attack or World Tour Quick Cash.

In comparison, the player's opinion on the 93R is that it is one of the worst light weapons, despite recent improvements in its range and spread. The player feels that burst weapons like the 93R are intended for landing headshots, but this is difficult in 'The Finals'. The player suggests that a higher headshot modifier would be beneficial. The player ranks the 93R in the D tier, indicating that it is less effective compared to other weapons. The player's opinion on the CL-40 grenade launcher is not directly mentioned in this text. However, they discuss many other weapons in the game 'The Finals'. For example, the V9s weapon is described as having high DPS but being difficult to use due to the sights, leading to it being placed in the B tier. They also mention the LH1 that received a buff improving its animation. Furthermore, they discuss the SH1 1900, which has been significantly buffed, leading to it potentially becoming meta again. The SH1 1900 is praised for its high damage output, making it effective in both quick cash and terminal attack game modes. The text provided doesn't directly mention any opinions about the CL-40 grenade launcher in the game 'The Finals'. Other weapons such as the SH1 1900, MP5 L1, M11, and a sniper are discussed, but without explicit mention or analysis of the CL-40 grenade launcher, it's impossible to provide detailed opinions or weapon balancing information about it. The reviewer provides an in-depth analysis of various weapons in the game 'The Finals', however, there is no mention of the CL-40 grenade launcher. They discuss weapons like the lh1 sniper rifle, SR 94, and the dagger, but do not provide any opinions or details on the CL-40 grenade launcher. From the text, it appears that the user does not provide opinions on the CL-40 grenade launcher specifically. However, he gives several insights on weapon balancing in the game 'The Finals'. He mentions that all melee weapons now have multi-hits, which he thinks is a good addition, but he believes it will take some time to adapt to this change. He also talks about the changes to the sword and throwing knives. He thinks that the removal of the sword emote cancels was a good move, but he feels that the sword's effectiveness decreases as the level of play increases. He also mentions changes to the throwing knives, with the main primary fire being nerfed and the secondary fire being buffed. He believes this shifts the power from being a left-click spammer to a more balanced use of both left and right clicks, but overall he considers this a nerf. The user didn't mention the CL-40 grenade launcher in the given text. However, they did share opinions on other weapons. They believe that if a weapon is easy to use, then it's good. They deem throwing knives to be annoying but not super effective against skilled teams, placing them in the B tier. The user also expresses mixed feelings about the bow, stating that it's somewhat clunky to use. They have learned to manage its awkwardness but still feel disadvantaged against most meta weapons, especially at different ranges. They don't see a high-ranked viability for the bow, particularly against skilled players using meta compositions and meta weapons. They also note that the bow has a lot of overlap with the throwing knives. The opinion on the CL-40 grenade launcher in the game 'The Finals' is not explicitly addressed in the provided text. However, it is mentioned that projectile weapons, which the CL-40 grenade launcher presumably falls under, do not provide consistent damage. It is stated that even the best players cannot rely on such weapons due to their inconsistent performance. 

As for the other weapon opinions in the medium class, the F car and AKM are highlighted. The F car is considered unchanged and remains at the top of the list, earning an S tier rating due to its all-around functionality and the presence of a scope. Despite its annoying recoil, it is still considered the best weapon in the game. 

The AKM is also well-regarded, being placed in the S tier alongside the F car. It is praised for its good damage output, large magazine size, and easier recoil control. The choice between the F car and the AKM is identified as a matter of personal preference rather than one weapon being definitively better than the other. The player's opinion on the CL-40 grenade launcher in the game 'The Finals' appears to be mixed. The player acknowledges that there have been some buffs to the weapon such as a faster shooting speed and less self-damage. However, they express dissatisfaction with its overall utility and effectiveness. They specifically point out that it's a projectile weapon that can be countered to some extent with the APS. They also note that it doesn't deal substantial damage unless the user scores a direct hit. Another point of criticism is that it's a splash damage weapon, which they believe is risky and does not provide consistent damage - something they deem as a crucial aspect of a weapon. They classify the CL-40 grenade launcher as a C tier weapon, indicating that they consider it a below-average choice in the game's current state. The user believes that the CL-40 grenade launcher in 'The Finals' fits well into the B tier, although it cannot be compared to the S tier and A tier weapons. This user also compares it to the LH1 for the medium class, stating that it's not as strong but somewhat similar. They mention that it provides the ability to trade with opponents at a certain range. 

In addition, the user talks about the Model 87, saying that it's good for carrying and can be used in different game modes such as 'termal attack' and 'quick cach' or 'cash out'. They highlight its high burst damage and clutch potential, even placing it above the revolver and the Famas due to these attributes. 

The user also brings up the Duel Swords, stating they are fun to play, especially against single fire weapons like the bow, shotgun, or sniper. However, they feel the Duel Swords are not effective against fully automatic weapons if the enemy is aware of your approach, describing them as 'fun and gimmicky'. 

Overall, the user seems to be satisfied with the weapon balancing although they believe certain weapons could be improved or adjusted. The user does not mention the CL-40 grenade launcher in this text, so no opinions or data regarding this weapon can be extracted from the provided information. The user primarily discusses the effectiveness of the J katanas, the riot shield, and the winch claw. They believe the J katanas are overrated, placing them in E tier, and view the riot shield as one of the worst weapons in the game, especially due to its ineffectiveness against flamethrowers and melee weapons. They also mention that the winch claw counters the riot shield, but no specific tier or ranking is provided for it. From the given text, there doesn't seem to be any specific opinion about the CL-40 grenade launcher for the game 'The Finals.' The user is expressing their thoughts about the R Shield and heavy M60, stating that the R Shield is one of the worst weapons in the game and their preference for the revolver. The user also mentions that the initial kick of the M60 has changed, and once you get past the initial recoil, it is very easy to use. However, there are no comments or opinions about the CL-40 grenade launcher. The user seems to be comparing the CL-40 grenade launcher, also referred to as ""Lou gun"", to the M60 weapon in the game 'The Finals'. They express dissatisfaction with the Lou gun, highlighting issues like high recoil and horizontal displacement, which they believe negatively impacts the weapon's performance. The user also notes that the Lou gun's recoil seems minimal for the first 5-10 bullets but then becomes more aggressive throughout the rest of the shooting pattern, making it less viable for prolonged use.

They suggest that the developers intended for the Lou gun to be a burst weapon due to its smaller magazine size, but they feel this is counterintuitive for a heavy-class weapon, which they believe should be able to continuously apply pressure and damage on the front line.

The user rates the M60 weapon as A tier, while they place the Lou gun a tier below, in B tier. They acknowledge some personal preference in these ratings and emphasize that a weapon being fun doesn't necessarily mean it's strong in ranked gameplay. The user expresses the idea that winning is fun to them, and thus a weapon's strength is a key factor in their enjoyment of the game. The opinion about the CL-40 grenade launcher (also referred to as MGL 32 in the text) in the game 'The Finals' appears to be quite negative. The weapon is considered as one of the worst in the game due to its inconsistent damage. It requires bouncing one pill and having it hit an enemy, which seems to not yield much damage. The only instance where it is deemed useful is when a large group of enemies is bunched up together, where it can cause significant clump damage. However, it doesn't contribute much to map impact or game progression.

The weapon is seen as particularly ineffective when enemies are close, as it can cause self-damage to the player. Even when used with the winch claw, which pulls enemies closer, it seems to lead to more self-damage and thus, less overall effectiveness.

The opinion concludes that the grenade launcher is only good for flushing out rooms and that it is not consistently damaging, which is an important factor in the game. Due to these reasons, the weapon is ranked in the 'F' tier, indicating its low effectiveness and viability. 

There isn't any specific comment regarding the weapon balancing aspect of the CL-40 grenade launcher, but the negative views suggest that it may need rebalancing to improve its performance and user appeal. The provided text does not contain any specific opinions or data about the CL-40 grenade launcher in the game 'The Finals'. Instead, it talks about the performance and usage of the flamethrower and the ks23 weapons in the game. For any detailed feedback or views on the CL-40 grenade launcher, please provide the relevant text or information. The user's opinion on the CL-40 grenade launcher in 'The Finals' seems to be mixed. They believe that it isn't significantly powerful, and can't one-shot an opponent with 100 health. However, they also note that it pairs well with the winch tool, which seems to elevate its usability in the current season. The user mentions that the game's current meta encourages close combat, making the grenade launcher a viable choice against aggressive melee players. However, it's effectiveness is greatly dependent on team support and strategy. The user also suggests that the grenade launcher's effectiveness is heightened in the right environment and with the right strategy. They ended by saying that they had the most fun using the sledgehammer weapon, which suggests that they prefer it over the CL-40 grenade launcher. The opinion on the CL-40 grenade launcher for 'The Finals' isn't explicitly mentioned in the provided text. The discussion centers around the sledgehammer and the spear, two different weapons in the game. The speaker suggests that the sledgehammer is somewhat overpowered, versatile, and fun to use, but may not be effective against a skilled team. They place it in the C tier alongside the k23. The spear, on the other hand, is a new weapon that has an area of effect damage and a pushing ability, though it's noted to be unreliable. The speaker also criticizes the spear for having an odd damage distribution and for its overall performance, which they found unsatisfactory. The person giving their opinion on the CL-40 grenade launcher for the game 'The Finals' seems to have a negative view on the weapon. They believe it is heavily gimmicky and lacks reliable damage, comparing it unfavorably to other weapons in the game. They think it's very poor even when compared to melee weapons, and suggest using the sledgehammer instead because it offers more enjoyment and effective combos with the Winch. 

They express disappointment at the new weapons added in the game, wishing that more competitive and higher tier weapons were introduced instead of just average or mid-tier ones. They are not happy with the trend in season 2 and 3 of adding weapons that are not highly competitive.

Despite their criticisms, they remain engaged with the game and are planning to produce more content for it, indicating that they are still invested in 'The Finals' despite their issues with some of its weapons. They also encourage viewers to leave comments and share their own views, suggesting they value community feedback and discussion."
The Finals best weapons season 3,gPg32VDwju8,I Used &amp; Ranked EVERY THE FINALS Weapon (Season 3 Tier List),how's it going folks the weapons in the finals have gone through some serious changes since my last tier list and since we haven't received any more balance changes in the most recent patch I think it's about time to remake a new list of the best and worst weapons in the [Music] finals and Now ladies and gentlemen may I present to you our most dangerous contestant in the arena L homo all right folks I'll rank each weapon purely on its strength in the current state of the game not on how fun they are to use or my personal preference if that were the case the list would probably be completely reversed okay so without any more hesitation let's get into it starting out with s tier I'm also labeling this tier as instant Advantage meaning that in my opinion if you pick these weapons you're straight up in a better position than you would have been using the weapons in the tiers below starting with the F car nothing's new with this one folks as far as I can remember the F car has always been the best gun in the game and it still is is with a very low skill barrier other than getting used to the recoil the F car lets you use a stupidly strong weapon that is probably better than most of Lights weapons all while getting to play as a medium with an extra 150 HP there isn't a whole lot more to it I think there are other weapons that are better than the fcar but it's the fact that the medium build gets to have such a strong weapon that puts it at the top of the list now folks if I made this list at the start of season 3 then the L H1 would definitely be at number one but since they reverted the damage buff it's kind of found its place the visual recoil buff is still crazy though and that's why I'm picking it as the second best weapon in the game it has equal damage at all ranges the only downside to it is that you will have to be more static when you're aiming with it because the bloom When jumping or strafing is very random and just to follow it up the M11 and xp54 these SMGs are always going to be ridiculous in the right hands I think the M11 is the better weapon although it does require a completely different play style compared to the XP if you can adapt the close range In-N-Out play style that the double barrel Mains use then the M11 is clear 40 rounds shreds Health great hip fire and jump accuracy and it has a quicker reload to the XP these are the reasons why I prefer it as an SMG now saying that the XP is still an amazing weapon and I'm still putting it in s tier it gives you a much larger range than most of light's other weapons and it has a ridiculous headshot multiplier the sights and recoil require only very basic skill the XP is definitely one of the easiest weapons to use in the game and if it wasn't for the slow reload time and the inaccurate hipfire accuracy then it would easily be the best light weapon all right moving on to a tier I'm calling this tier great but not OP starting out with the model 1887 the model at its core stands in a play where it could be considered a top three weapon it has great range doesn't require aiming down sights very strong damage and a quick enough fire rate but it has a seriously tough fatal flaw the model's reload animation has what I would consider to be some sort of bug but since it's been in the game for so long I guess it's intended the problem is that sometimes when reloading this gun it won't allow you to shoot to cancel the animation now what's strange about it is that sometimes you can shoot but then other times you have to wait for the full animation to bring the gun back to six rounds for that reason alone I'm putting it at the top of a tier but not quite s tier the AK fits in perfectly as an a tier weapon it hits relatively hard at all ranges has nearly too much ammo a decent headshot multiplier and is generally just known to be an allrounder weapon it's boring but does the job and it's great for team play such as breaking Shields and equipment I don't compare it to the F car because it isn't as strong especially if you have decent aim the F car always lands on top but if you're looking for something a little more forgiving then the AK is perfect finishing off a tier we have the M60 in my last list the Lewis gun was ahead as the best heavy weapon but since the recoil change in season 3 I had to say that the M60 is just better 70 rounds crazy headshot damage and it's kind of odd to say but its recoil really isn't that much worse than the Lewis guns right now uh the heavy weapons aren't really on the same level as medium or lights but then then again you have to factor in that you get so much extra Health with the heavy build and for that reason the M60 is making its way into a tier on this list now we move on to B tier to sum this tier up these are weapons that have really high capabilities but will be limited by the amount of skill it would require to be consistent with them starting out with the sniper obviously the sniper has some of the highest damage potential in the game and so that's what is putting it so high in this tier I think the sniper use case has grown a lot in season 3 especially if you play ranked terminal attack another thing about the sniper is that people really do underestimate how effective it can be with an aggressive play style I love using grapple sniper but not in a hard scope camping like a [Â __Â ] kind of way the silenced pistol practically just as strong if not stronger than both SMGs but it just requires way too much effort to even match what they can do it's amazing don't get me wrong but having to single fire and maintain good aim with a weird sights just puts it as an exhaustive way to match the xp's effectiveness the Lewis gun was once considered without a doubt the go-to heavy weapon but the recent recoil change has really messed up this weapon's effective range in my opinion still does a job in close range but once you even get to that mid-range area I find that maintaining accuracy no matter how good your aim is is going to be very tedious and especially when you consider that it holds half the ammo Mo as the M60 you won't be given the same wiggle room to spray and prey in situations that require it the recurve bow I love it such a breath of fresh air weapon now I do have to switch over to mouse and keyboard to use it but that just highlights the type of weapon it is I don't think it's better than the sniper but it is very strong and if you can get the timing down with it it can be really fun to pair with Dash and Gateway I think this tier is perfect for its use case and skill requirement I have always ranked the throwing knives is one of the worst weapons in the finals and I stand by it that until the buff these things were just a joke weapon but since the buff and even after the recent damage Nerf I think the projectile speed and accuracy change has turned the knives into a very viable option for lights style points head shot beams and no reload makes the knives so much fun to use and in terms of criticism the only major flaw is their range which is very small making them an easy counter for players who've copped onto the knives play style the double barrel change is an odd one for me obviously the damage buff is amazing being able to twoot Heavies and not having to awkwardly dance around them while waiting to reload but we also see a much larger spread now in slower fire rate meaning that you have to basically be inside the enemy to kill them I think this tier is ideal for this weapon in the right hands and with great movement it's going to be super annoying to play against but then again the the counter is so simple that I just can't put it any higher C tier weapons these are all solid but really wouldn't reach much higher on the list due to their potential for me starting with the flamethrower good damage intimidating Pest Control you wouldn't even need hands to aim with this thing but it's super situational I love the flamethrower but one stun gun or enemy on high ground and it's over the slug shot gun very underrated other than the weird aiming perspective and the pet travel time I think the slug is a great pick for Heavies 100 plus damage at long range and a good fire rate make this thing really nice to pair up with heav tech perfect for cleaning up fights or third partying the FAS it received another buff but I'm still not able to get with it the gun can be effective but it feels so limited in situations where I'm trying to wrap a fight up quickly I almost always feel like the FAS is just one or two shots shy of finishing a kill and even though it has basically zero recoil it just isn't strong enough to compete with the other ARS for me once you get past the sights and Bloom with movement then the revolver turns out to be a really hard-hitting weapon it does require Landing head shot to be effective at range but unfortunately even with amazing accuracy I find the damage drop off to be way too short for the revolver I do think it's due a range buff at this stage of the game especially when you consider how few people actually pick this gun I love it though to be honest and I think it is a solid weapon the dagger is also a solid weapon the backstab can one shot every build in the game even Heavies if you add an instant quick melee obviously that statement makes it sound op but the fact is that it requires the same play style as the double barrel plus the ability to always land hits in the back because if you don't land the stab in the enemy's back then you'd be better off trying to emote in front of them hoping for Mercy I'm putting the sword right next to the dagger I know some people would have it the other way around but the thing is without animation cancelling and with the removal of the multi-hit function the sword is at the worst point it's ever been now I do think it's strong in quick play modes banket and power shift especially but other than that the sword's capacity is limited by its range and it's similar to the flamethrower in a situational sense just with less than half the health on your side still a solid weapon on this list by the way the sa 1216 just like in my previous list I think it's the most overrated heavy weapon this gun's rhythm is too awkward like that weird Jazz from the movie Whiplash except in the end you don't Master it but you realize that you won't be one of the greats because Jazz is mid and scraping its way into C tier is the sledgehammer much more useful now with the hook ability the sledgehammer is a super strong weapon and is amazing for defending cash outs unfortunately it's also been affected by the removal of multi- hit so you can no longer hit those three pieces in one shot realistically though it's just in the same boat as the other melee weapons too easy to counter but great nonetheless now we're into D tier folks I could have put these weapons in CTI here but I just felt that they deserve to be separated from those above it the dual blades I want to love these they are quite strong and the deflect is a nice feature but I do think that they're meant to be used more aggressively than the riot shield and medium just doesn't have the mobility for that play style I also wish they buff the time it takes to switch from attacking to deflecting because it's too slow for close-range combat the cl40 I may not be a fan of this weapon but man the recent Nerf has actually [Â __Â ] it the splash damage is like blowing farts at the enemy and I do feel bad for the players that M it because it must be really frustrating to have to use more ammo than you have to begin with in order to finish a kill and folks the spear yeah I mean it's decent but the hammer is better for me the extra range is a nice bonus and the alt fire is great for power shift plays but I mean come on it's a quickplay weapon and that's fine but it won't be making its way up the list for me anytime soon finally our e tier weapons if you use these you enjoy the little things in life like looking at nature and playing with crayons and coloring books the burst pistol when I read the patch notes for season 3 it looked like they buffed it oh man I was wrong it's actually just a disadvantage to use it damage and range is too low and the mag size is just sad best of luck to anyone who's willing to give it some love the heavy grenade launcher I'm promoting it from the worst weapon in the game to the second worst congratulations to anyone who mans this gun you're making your way up bro it is possible to have some success with this weapon but at what cost I mean sure if you give it plenty of hours and get the angles down then you'll start seeing enemies Health drop bit by bit but then again when I come against a heavy and see that they're using this thing it's a nice little moment of relief last and also least the riot shield [Â __Â ] me I love this thing I mean it's the most frustrating weapon to play with and play against it sucks ass but I find it to be so bad that I actually can have fun using it chasing after lights who can simply just run in a straight line for eternity without any consequences is so satisfying when I'm trying to get myself ready to sleep I also find it very soothing and therapeutic to close my eyes and have a nap between the melee animation by the the time I wake up I'm just about getting to the second hit and the game's just about over folks that has been my weapons tier list for season 3 of the finals I love nothing more than hearing all your thoughts and opinions so be sure to let me know what you'd have done differently in the comment section if you have any questions I'll do my best to respond ratings and follows are greatly appreciated thanks very much for watching bye-bye now,"The user's opinion on the weapon balancing in 'The Finals' is that it has undergone significant changes since the last tier list, and no additional balance changes have been implemented in the recent patch. The user believes it's time to remake a new tier list of the best and worst weapons in the game.

Regarding the CL-40 grenade launcher, the user does not specifically mention this weapon in their discussion. They focus on the F car, which they consider to be the best gun in the game due to its low skill barrier and powerful capabilities. The user also mentions the L H1, which would have been their top pick at the start of season 3, however, since the damage buff was reverted, it's now in second place. The user concludes by mentioning the M11 and xp54 SMGs as other weapons of note.

To get detailed opinions about the CL-40 grenade launcher, more specific feedback or comments about that particular weapon would be needed.

The review does not provide any specific opinion on the CL-40 grenade launcher from the game 'The Finals'. The user discussed other weapons such as the F car, AK, M60, Lewis gun, sniper, and the silenced pistol but did not mention the CL-40 grenade launcher. The user feels that the CL-40 grenade launcher in 'The Finals' has some balance issues, particularly due to its limited ammo capacity. They compare it unfavorably to the M60, stating that the M60 allows for more flexibility in play style, especially in situations that require 'spray and pray' tactics. 

They also express a liking for the recurve bow, praising it as a 'breath of fresh air' and noting that it has a high skill requirement, which they appreciate. They do not think it surpasses the sniper, but they find it to be strong and enjoyable to use in conjunction with the Dash and Gateway abilities. 

Their opinion of the throwing knives has improved significantly since their buff, stating that the increased speed and accuracy have made them a much more viable weapon choice. However, they criticize the knives for their limited range, which they believe makes them easy to counter.

As for the double-barrel change, they find it to be a questionable adjustment. They appreciate the damage increase but have issues with the wider spread and slower fire rate, which forces players to be in close proximity to their targets for effective use.

The Finals best weapons season 3,P7wVJgmYQkY,Ultimate MODEL 1887 Masterclass Guide &amp; Aim Training! | The Finals Season 3,I got to be honest with you guys learn this shotgun had its ups and downs or to be more accurate felt like I was on a roller coaster some days I would pop off and on other days I felt like I could have hit a shot for the life of me but once I learned what made this weapon tick and how to bring consistency to the table I started to get some serious results so in this master class I'm going to show you all the ins and outs of the 1887 shotgun what type of play style that will give you the best chance of winning how to use on maps that highly favor range weapons what specialization and gadgets to pair with it and lastly how to train with it so you can bring out its full potential on a daily basis so before we get started if you found this video informative please don't forget to smash that like button before you leave it's a small button for you but makes a massive impact on my channel it allows me to keep doing things that I'm doing and providing you with the best content possible also subscribe Arena notification Bell for all things to finals let's get into it now as we all know if in the right hands this shotgun is a beast close to mid-range pumping out 160 damage per second it can demolish a medium and light with two shots in 58 seconds and a heavy with three shots at 1.58 seconds now on paper you'll see that this weapon doesn't really look that impressive especially when comparing it to powerful weapons from other classes however what makes this weapon shine Above the Rest is that it provides you with the ability to run and Gun in the truest sense allowing you to utilize the movement speed of hip firing while also gaining the accuracy that aiming down sights would provide allowing you to outmaneuver your opponent while punishing them for every shot missed with immense burst damage but with all the good this weapon has to offer it it does have its drawbacks first is the time to reload I can't tell you how many times I left the opponent with the sliver of health because my reload animation would not allow me to fire it's quite frustrating but fortunately for us until it is fixed there is an easy way to work around it and that is to Melly cancel the animation allowing you to fire the last shot needed to take down your opponent the second is tracking fast opponents at extremely close ranges for example a sword light using Dash or any one of the close- range high damage weapons in their Arsenal if you're able to increase your efficiency in that area of tracking everything else becomes easy with this weapon in fact I would go as far to say that this one aspect is what separates a good shotgun player from a great one but don't worry I've got a training routine later in this video that's going to help you step up your 1887 game guaranteed before we jump into the practice range though let's go over some important aspects which is play style now there are maps in this game that highly favor this weapon giving you lots of opportunities to engage in close-range combat allowing you to use this gun as intended however there are maps with long corridors a lot of open space with very little cover and will provide very little opportunity organically to close the gap to eliminate your Target in these Maps the two important factors that you need are patience and Mobility I can't tell you how many times I spectated players get so kill hungry that they completely disregard their cover and run through long Open Spaces in order to challenge an opponent that has a weapon that gives them clear range Advantage only to get eliminated by either the opponent they're chasing or their teammate which is most likely firing at them from their flank patience plays a huge role here you need to learn how to live to fight another day to retreat reposition and and utilize cover and enclose routes as much as possible always limiting the amount of time that you are exposed out in the open now I understand to some this may seem like a boring slow way to play but the good news is medium has gadgets such as jump pad and zipline as well as a specialization dematerializer that will help make closing the Gap that much easier essentially cutting the time it takes to get to your opponent in half abilities like these make it incredibly easy for the player to strategically make their way to the most advantageous position before engaging the enemy whether it be running straight through a building with a dematerializer breaking line of sight with a jump pad or zip line to move vertically onto a higher level or you could even use a zip line to Traverse faster horizontally again abilities like these are essentially what makes the medium shotgun extremely effective in just about every map and with a competent team that can provide shielding distraction and cover fire the 1887 shotgun becomes a force to be reckoned with now you don't necessarily need to have all three of these abilities to be effective just one to two would be enough for example I prefer using the turet gun coupled with the jump pad and zipline or you could even use the dematerializer to run straight through buildings you can mix and match these abilities as you see fit so that you can use a Loadout that is most fitting to your play style with that being said though nothing I just mention will work for you if on average you are landing 40% of your shots per mag this weapon rewards you for precision remember you only have six bullets to get the job done so you will be severely punished for any inaccuracies each missed shot will raise your ttk drastically so before we hop into the firing range I want you to keep a few things in mind the first is to utilize hip fire for the entirety of this training routine whether you are engaging in mid or close ranges the reason being is because you do not receive any inaccuracy penalties when hip firing and the bullet spread Remains the Same whether you are on hipfire or an ads this will allow you to move faster make you more aware of your surroundings and evade shots thus increasing your survivability for those of us that are used to automatic weapons this will take a little time to get used to because we've made a habit of aiming down sights for targets that are just outside of close range however I promise you that once you get used to shooting this way your Effectiveness with this weapon will double the second is to prioritize accuracy and smoothness over speed what I mean by speed is trying to look flashy and flicking your shots this will not only create bad habits but will also make your aim unreliable and basing your daily performance off of luck rather than skill essentially I want you to move smooth and accurately from shot to shot or from Target to Target so that you can eventually move fast and maintain that level of smoothness and accuracy I want you to remember this smoothness will always equate to speed so with that being said let's jump into it now as you already know if you watch any one of my master class videos we will always start with centering as a warm-up but this time there's a little bit of a Twist first start by centering one of the very many stationary Targets in the practice range for 3 minutes stay in Hip fire making long 1second strides from left to right while moving into close and mid-ranges and mixing it up a little by throwing in a couple of crouches after you are done with that I want you to make your way to the roof of the building and spend 3 minutes here centering this light moving Target at extremely close ranges moving around it and trying to keep it in the center of the screen as much as possible this war warm up and the scenario to follow are extremely important because this weapon does not have a lot of weaknesses when it comes to close-range engagement but I promise you the one Bane to your existence when running this shotgun will be a competent light utilizing Dash coming in incredibly fast and close thus forcing you to look down and track at that same speed for most this can prove to be very difficult in practice because you are going to have to drastically increase your average tracking speed just to keep up this is why we are warming up this aspect of centering so that when the time comes you not left flustered and moving sporadically but rather making shots like this because you already used to the rate at which the target is moving now let's move on to our first scenario and piggy back off this warm-up I want you to keep centering the targets and only fire when you were at extremely close ranges and not before constantly moving and being as evasive as possible eliminating 10 targets before moving on the next scenario we'll be moving on to will be mid-range tracking where we will use counter strafing or mirroring on the first moving Target while maintaining centering while reloading and even in between shots this will break the habit of moving the reticle away from the target after each shot essentially flicking as well as minimize the amount of micro adjustments needed before taking the next shot another thing to note is that mirroring makes it a lot easier to hit shots with the 1887 however it makes you an easier Target as well so just keep that in mind when you get into engagements eliminate 10 targets with two to three shots before moving on that is not achieved I want you to reload and start again the next and final scenario for this weapon is quite important although this may seem like a Target switching scenario I want you to consider it as a Target acquisition and click timing scenario like I said before accuracy is essential for this weapon if you are able to acquire and hit the target first the likelihood that you will win the engagement increases drastically because of the amount of burst damage this shotgun can do so what I want you to do is spend 5 minutes shooting the first moving Target then acquiring either one of the light targets to the left or the heavy Target to the right shooting one of them and then transitioning back to the first moving Target please prioritize smoothness and accuracy over everything else in this exercise if you trust the process I promise you the speed will come and that just about wraps things up I hope you guys enjoyed this video as much as I enjoyed making it I'll be honest with you at first taking up this weapon felt like a daunting task But as time went on this slowly became one of my favorite and most satisfying weapons to use if you found this video informative please don't forget to smash that like button it really really helps out the channel don't forget to subscribe for all things to finals I'll see you guys next time peace,"The provided text does not contain specific information or opinions about the CL-40 grenade

The Finals best weapons season 3,XAT91eOxhWE,Ranking ALL weapons in The Finals SEASON 3,with all the new and returning players in the finals season 3 I've decided to create a list of all the weapons in the game and where they stand in the current meta but before I can continue on with the video I have a really quick disclaimer you guys can use whatever you want or find the most fun I am not telling you that you have to use the guns I rank the highest or that you can't do well with the guns that I rank the lowest this whole list is just my opinion and is more so a guideline on the general state of the meta in the game at the moment this ranking is going to be based mainly on a weapons performance in ranked terminal attack in World Tour so I am not considering how good a weapon is on poers shift or banket in these rankings here's what all the tiers mean for the purposes of this video s tier has some of the best and most consistent guns in the game a tier has weapons that are very powerful but are either harder to use or aren't as versatile as their s tier counterparts B has weapons that are still good but can be more situational than the others and might have Maps they don't perform as well on CER has weapons that are good in Niche situations but lack versatility D tier has weapons that can be fun in casual modes but are simply too inconsistent for most players in ranked play the spear paired with either the Charon slam or the winch clock can be a very effective combo in many lobbies and doesn't require you to have particularly good aim to pull off however at higher levels of gameplay players will realize you are running a melee weapon and adapt their play style accordingly the weapon also suffers in usability when cash outs are in the open the spear is a pretty solid weapon that is going to go into the B tier just like the spear the sledgehammer can be very fun especially paired with the winch claw it also has the added ability to destroy terrain but doesn't have quite as much range as the spear does It suffers from some of the same issues that the spear has which is going to land it in the B tier but if you are looking to have a fun time and maybe even one shot an unsuspecting light this might be a good weapon for you the sa2 is a fantastic weapon that is a little harder to use than some of the melee weapons but will perform better in higher skill lobbies pairing it with the winch claw will allow you to get some guaranteed shots even against the dash lights if you use your ability well the sa2 is going into the a tier unfortunately the mg32 is just not a very good weapon in competitive modes at the moment the weapon can be a lot of fun and power shift or casual lobbies but isn't consistent enough to be considered good enough for higher tier play however if you personally love the grenade launcher or just want to have a bit of a laugh and aren't concerned with meta weapons the grenade launcher can be a fun option for you it's it's going to go into the D tier the M60 has been quite good this season has really good DPS and a great Max size the only thing that holds it back is recoil and its performance over range but if you take good engagements you can be very effective with this weapon in season 3 a tier the Lis gun is still in my opinion the best weapon for heavy in terms of straight consistency if you can get past the initial recoil the viability of this weapon is very good it has good damage over range and is good at closer ranged fights as well and while yes the sa2 might technically be better in those close range engagements when you pick up the L gun you are picking consistency and versatility for your team and the ability to fight at any level s tier with terminal attack being the new ranked mode this season the ks23 stocks have gone up a shotgun that is viable at longer ranges with the ability to inflict a lethal chip damage on opponents in a mode like terminal attack can be very effective if used right the only downsides to this gun is the long reload time and the lack of hit scan projectiles a tier the flamethrower can be an extremely fun and effective weapon in modes like Po shift where it has the ability to hit multiple targets at once however in higher ranked play the flamethrower loses some of its viability where it can be easily countered by good players if you don't have very good aim or just like to incinerate your enemies this gun can be extremely fun but might not be the best pick for those higher tier lobbies for that it is going into the C tier if you have good aim the revolver will serve you extremely well the inconsistencies of this weapon come from The Recoil as it is a bit jarring at times if you play a lot of Kovac or aim labs this weapon can be very effective in your hands it's going into the a tier the medium shotgun is a very good weapon for chip damage and close-range engagements but unlike shotguns in some other games this weapon requires you to have great aim to use effectively the longer reload time and unforgiving nature of the weapon are going to keep it in the a tier for me but it is still one of the best weapons that you can run on medium bullet has had some Nerf since its initial release the fcar remains a fantastic choice for medium players with a clean red dot sight and good damage the only thing holding this gun back is its aggressive recoil it's going into the a tier the Famas is a good option for mediums who like to take their fights at a little bit of a distance but it isn't as good at closer ranges when compared to guns such as the akm it's a solid choice for a medium weapon and is a great weapon for getting Chip damage and terminal attack so I'm putting it at the top of B tier the riot shield is going to be a bad weapon for 99% players but for the 1% that choose to master it the weapon can be very effective however medium is just not the strongest melee class in the game and against higher ranked players the riot shield can be very difficult to use I'm going to put it in DTI with notes saying that it can be a very fun weapon to use and that it has the potential for greatness but is simply too inconsistent to get a ton of value from the dual blades suffer from a lot of the same problems that the ri Shield has and are rather inconsistent however they are better than the riot shield in my opinion because the deflect gives it some range capability that the riot shield just doesn't have a very fun weapon for game modes like poers shift I'm going to put it in C tier with a very small magx size and projectile based attacks the cl40 could use some Buffs but it's still a fun weapon to use unfortunately if your opponent is using the aps turret you're kind of out of luck until it goes away I've seen some people get to Diamond with this gun but there are better options in terms of weapons with raw dueling capabilities let's go in the C tier the akm is the most consistent gun in the game with a large magazine size that has the ability to burst down heavy Shields it's good at every single range and is the perfect weapon for heal beam mediums I can't put this fantastic weapon anywhere other than the S tier for its consistency and the utility it provides in high ranked play much like the akm the xp54 is one of the most consistent weapons in the game with an emphasis on close to mid-range engagements the Red Dot site makes it a perfect pairing with the cloaking device and the fire rate is easy to handle s tier the v9s has fantastic damage with a really satisfying gameplay loop it's a very fun weapon to use but it drops off and viability at some of the longer ranges and it has very bad Iron Sights paired with some pretty hard to control recoil the v9s goes into a tier the throwing knives got a huge buff right at the end of season 2 the new buff made the throwing knives become some of the best close-range weapons in the game albeit with a bit of a higher skill ceiling and while they've nerfed the damage a little bit with the patch that they released today this change should only be felt when facing medium players and should still be a great option for dash lights the only other issue with this weapon is that it becomes almost completely useless at longer ranges it's going in the AER the sword is one of the best melee weapons in the game and can get you some really good kills if you learn how to use it since the emo cancelling exploit has been fixed it's not as good as it once was but it is still a fantastic weapon for lights on certain Maps B tier with powers shift becoming the new ranked mode the king of Chip damage has become much more viable than it previously was if you have good aim the sr84 has the potential to be a very valuable asset to your team in ranked this season however if you take closer range engagements the weapons usability takes a little bit of a nose dive I've also seen that it is pretty strong in poers shift but I'm not going to be letting that influence this ranking for today B tier the S off shotgun was quite Bad in season 2 but with the start of season 3 it got some healthy Buffs which made the weapon viable in high rank to play again it has insane DPS with the potential to two shot Heavies but becomes useless at longer ranges an a tier gun that is terrifying in close ranges the recurve bow is a very fun weapon to use but it's not very competitively viable the nature of its projectile attacks make it a worse weapon than the sniper at longer ranges and its DPS makes it worse than the throwing knives at closer ranges it has the ability to one shot a light if you get a head shot so it can be a good swap weapon if you have many light players inside of your game but other than that Niche situation I have to put it in the C tier the M11 has secretly been a little bit of a close-range monster for the past few seasons and has flown under the radar in the rank scene it isn't as consistent at range as the xp54 but has the potential to put out crazy damage in the right engagement scenarios trust me hip fire this thing a tier unfortunately the 93r could use some it's a fun weapon to use but not the best at anything and in its current state there isn't much reason to run this over guns like the xp54 M11 or v9s if you don't care about the meta the gun is very fun to use but it is unfortunately outclassed most of the time see tier the dagger is an interesting weapon it's very fun to play with the possibility of being able to one shot opponents with the right click if you can get behind them but in my personal experience this opportunity doesn't come as often as you might hope there is a dash te that allows you to hit an opponent in the back while you dash at them but you have to be able to do it perfectly and it can be very inconsistent the dagger goes into C tier but it has the potential to do very well if you master it at the start of season 3 The lh1 was super oppressive and had consistently insane DPS at every range it's been nerfed a little bit as of today and while it will still feel powerful it won't be nearly as oppressive and now can be outgun at shorter ranges by SMGs and shotguns and for that reason I'm going to put it at the very top of a tier now that's every weapon in the finals ranks if you think some of these weapons need Buffs or nervs what changes would you make also what changes would you make to my list should some of these weapons be a little bit higher or lower than I put them let me know in the comments down below and with that thank you all so much for watching

The CL-40 grenade launcher in 'The Finals' has mixed opinions. While it is recognized as a fun weapon that can potentially one-shot light classes, it is unfortunately considered to be not very good in competitive modes. The inconsistency of the weapon's performance makes it less appealing for higher tier play. This grenade launcher is recommended for players who are not concerned with meta weapons and want to have a bit of a laugh.

It only gives insights into other weapons such as the flamethrower, revolver, medium shotgun, Fcar, Famas, and the riot shield. Please provide a text that talks about the CL-40 grenade launcher. Players have mixed opinions about the CL-40 grenade launcher in 'The Finals'. While it is viewed as a fun weapon to use, it is also seen as inconsistent due to its small magazine size and projectile-based attacks. It is perceived that the CL-40 could benefit from some improvements to increase its reliability and effectiveness in the game. Some players have managed to reach high ranks using this weapon, but there are generally considered to be better options for weapons with more robust dueling capabilities. The CL-40 is less effective when opponents are using the APS turret, which can nullify its effectiveness until it is deactivated. Despite these limitations, some players still enjoy using this weapon due to its unique gameplay mechanics, placing it in the C tier. However, it is not considered as reliable or versatile as top-tier weapons like the AKM or the XP54.

Players find it fun, but it is considered to be outperformed by other weapons such as the xp54 M11 or v9s. The overall opinion is that there's not much incentive to use the CL-40 if one is focused on playing within the meta.

The Dagger, another medium class weapon, is seen as intriguing due to its one-shot potential when attacking opponents from behind. However, this tactic is viewed as inconsistent and hard to master, leading to its classification in the C tier. Yet, with mastery, it is believed to have the potential to perform well.

The lh1, which was viewed as overpowered at the start of Season 3 due to its high DPS at all ranges, has been nerfed. While it remains strong, it is no longer as dominating and can now be outgunned at short ranges by SMGs and shotguns. The nerf has placed it at the top of the A tier.

In general, there is an open discussion on whether some weapons need further balancing changes. The community is invited to share their opinions on ways to adjust the weapon tiers or propose buffs or nerfs for specific weapons."
The Finals best weapons season 3,2rTYn15yBc4,9 MUST-USE Loadouts for The Finals Season 3,here are nine different loadouts that you can use in the final season 3 to have a leg up against the enemy so starting off we have the lh1 invis glitch Gateway the lh1 is probably hands down the best weapon in the game at the moment it has a no recoil 51 or sorry 53 damage per shot so you fre tapa light uh four tapa sorry five tapa medium and then seven I think for heavy if you Hees it goes even faster and it's so easy to control now it's just really good especially over mid to Long ranges to go with that I would suggest going with a kind of you can go with a grapple but I would probably say that you want to do with a dash so you can actually move around mid fight and reposition so you can get high ground so just get a little bit of distance between you and enemy and then of course you're going to run the invas uh to make up for the fact you don't have a cloak a glitch to break through Shields and then a Gateway for like all the types of suppored plays you can do this load out specifically like I said is good for just dashing around shooting people a little bit further away if you can squint really hard and you have a really good resolution you can even shoot enemies that are across lost the map and just pick them off when there's nothing that they can do very good CHS for light this season or especially this patch I don't know if it's going to be Nerf or not but it's a very good choice very much recommended other than that we have a Loadout that just came back recently which is extremely good is sh1 1900 cloak if you guys have been around since the start of season 1 you remember this thing absolutely shredding and it was buffed this patch the sh 1900 now one shots a light Two Shots a medium and two shots a heavy a assuming you hit meat shots super fun to play and you can run this either with a dash for Content or if you feel like you want to jump on a lot or what I would actually recommend is going full rat with it and running it with a cloak in which case you can just shoot an enemy cloak and reload and then come out of cloak again and shoot them again or shoot the next one assuming you oneshot them extremely viable assuming you're running it with cloak I would suggest running a I of course suggest running it with a stun gun this season because the stun gun has been buffed like crazy a glitch grenade and a Gateway I would almost say that Gateway is a must have because the viability and versatility that it gives your kid is just Next Level we're doing this live on twitch.tv/ by the way um moving on we have the xp54 meta cloak Loadout or whatever it's basically the same as sh1 1900 except instead of going for individual picks you kind of just keep looking for a flank on the enemy with the xp54 and then beam them just deal a lot of damage with it you still want to use the stunt gun for the individual stunts because uh if you don't know the season you know any stun enemy now cannot use their specialization which means that they can't use their specialization not even not their hook not their winch not their uh charging slam Shield or whatever so if you get a stun most of the time it is a free kill and what's so good about xp54 is that while the shotgun is good for one shots and picking off individual targets the xp54 just gives consistent damage across all ranges assuming you have a good Regal control coming out of cloak with it you have the nice scope which helps a lot um it's a very good combo all of these items play off of each other a lot in this Loadout so I recommend it a lot we do have another light we want to share later in the video but we're going to hop on over to medium I'm going to talk a little bit about Medium as well so as for medium you're going to start with the support medium most play Styles especially ones I'm talking about are either not as good to season or not meta because of changes to their kit and just kind of like the type of meta that people are playing or what what people are playing uh but what something that always will stay true is of course support light support light is basically a healing beam a I want to say an akm but you can do an F car if you feel more comfortable with that uh but akm will give you more sustained damage is easier to control and you have a larger magazine so you can just keep putting out damage and help your team you don't want want to follow up with one movement item which is either a zipline or jump pad I feel like a jump pad can be really good on Kyoto even though sliding into jump pads has been nerfed this season you can still put it on the many different Ledges and slanted roofs that you can see on Kyoto to rotate fast but if you want to do line that's fine too uh as for the third item I would probably make that the aps because that allows you to set up on the point and hold it and tank incoming RPGs or projectile shots that would take you out otherwise and of course as for the final item in the support medium Loadout that will always be the defibrillator because the defibrillator is a lot better than it's just good you bring your teammate back to life it's always going to be really good moving on we have the Fragger model medium now this role is generally just a Fragger or or movement roll there's a lot of there's a lot of crossover so we can call it a Fragger medium or movement medium whatever you feel like but usually you want to run a model or a f car maybe even an akm if you feel comfortable with it and the whole purpose of this Loadout is to try to play flanks play high grounds and put down a lot of damage over mid ranges or even closer with the shotgun that will that will help your team even though you're not supporting them directly to help you out with this you have the dematerializer which will allow you to get huge flanks pull up some movement clips uh and just do a lot of different versatile plays that you cannot do with let's say a heal beam or a guardian turret because those are more supportive or defensive uh you want to do both a jump pad and a zip line with the movement medium because it just lets you jump around and you stay on the Move constantly and of course I want to say you can go with a grenade for the fourth the last slot in the gadgets if you would rather do that personally especially with how sweaty World Tour is I would probably run defibrillators but you can if you're on a Model you don't have a lot of range you can use a frag grenade as well to get a little bit of opening damage is completely up to you and whether your other teammate assuming they're playing medium is going to support your other you and your teammate as well uh moving on we have the sa 126 heavy with the winch the winch was added this season allows you to yink an enemy in polman and kill them I have learned that it is a bit awkward to use sa 1216 because it doesn't hit super hard but it is a load out that you can use as a heavy to kind of build off of the winch it basically this load out essentially exists sort of just to counter the current or the previous meta for heavy which is uh or in just in general which is a double heavy medium with a lot of shields because if you don't know the the winch goes through a shield and just Ys the enemy out of there you know just got your nose except the nose is your medium and now you lost a team fight because he's out of position and can't fight back the sc26 doesn't deal that much damage you need a Full Burst to kill but it is still interesting there's also a interesting Tech where you can shoot four shots with the s216 and then start a hook as you are reloading and then once the hook is finished you actually still have there four new fresh shots the winch actually animation cancels the uh the little reload of the s26 does so it's pretty strong in that sense it's just not super strong as far as Weapons go because I noticed we did better with the next load out than we did with this one but I'm going to explain this s it real quick first again that is winch claw s 2016 you have a barricade to give you cover to give you Mobility uh and to C off a line of sights you have an RPG for long range damage or just blasting somebody especially like a light or even a medium with the winch claw after pull with the winch claw and then the Dome shield for additional Shields very strong very strong but the best use in at least in my opinion of the winch claw of than just having it as something you use occasionally to like pull the cash out in or grabbing a statue or doing something fun with it is combining the wind winch claw with the sludgehammer which is probably my favorite winch claw comp this season so far at the very least you have so many there's so many combos you can pull off with the heavy Sledgehammer winch claw that you cannot pull off with any other weapon and especially not the spear which is a new Mele season so for example if you pull in a light you will do 15 damage from the winch then you hit him once with a left click and then melee immediately assuming they didn't dash out of the way and even if it dash out of the way if it were quick enough you will One-Shot them they're just going to immediately die if you pull in a medium you just right click and then the same thing cuz it's 15 damage and then I believe 40 damage from the melee puts you at 255 I believe damage which is enough to one shot a medium just with a right click and they don't have a escape to get away from you in time so they're just practically dead uh if you play against a heavy if you winch in a heavy won't be as strong but just a good old tried and true right click left click and then melee cancel very strong very good moving on to go with this you want to barricade you could have line of sight what's especially good with heavy is that you can put a barricade and then climb it climb cancel and start a right click if an enemy is like right in front of you and you cannot like just jump over your barricade and you slap them in the head works extremely well believe me because it's been done to me and I've been doing it to others uh very good combo RPG again for Destruction and damage and of course you have the Dome Shield to just give you additional Health you can play inside of the Dome shield and kind of smack people around uh or just play around the Dome Shield so they can't shoot you back while you keep hitting them very very strong load out overall that being said of course I do have to give a shout to the OG one of my favorites and after I've used it it's still one of my favorites it's a charge and slam M60 AKA Rambo Heaven uh heavy sorry Rambo heavy is so good because you you can basically you obviously you can charge in Slam to open up a fight or deal instant damage it's 130 I believe for the first charge and 50 for each consecutive hit it's AOE you can add a slam at the end it just do a massive burst of damage Plus can destroy uh enemy cover you can destroy walls bring down buildings whatever there's a lot of Destruction very valuable specialization overall might even be more valuable than the winch still assuming you don't want to counter the mesh Shield better to go with this I'm choosing the M60 and not the ls gun I already been have been defending the M60 since before this patch but with this patch I feel like that kind of puts the final nail and coffin for the L gun if you guys don't know the L gon now has like 58 shots and then with no recoil and then the recoil just goes crazy high and and you have a I'm not sure about the DPS I haven't really random numbers yet but I believe it's probably about the same as M60 still if not lower uh maybe even even if it's a slightly higher the higher recoil just makes it not worth it whereas M60 is the complete inverse with pretty high recoil which you can learn to compensate for like eight bullets and then it has practically no recoil for the rest of your magazine for the like 62 bullets you shoot there will be no recoil is a perfect for Rambo heavy just jump in throw down your Shields your barricade chargeing time if you want and then just do transfers just beam everyone super fun to just stand still and kill everyone who even looks at you to go with that obviously we have the barricade climbs cover RPG more range of Destruction and Dome Shield so you can have that additional plus believe 350 Health which gives you a edge against anyone else you play against against most Heavies charge slam most item in game absolutely yeah Rambo play style just literally you go just kill everyone it's amazing I love that setup so much so fun to play real Chad gameplay that puts us at eight different loadouts for the season there's one more which I promise you guys at the very end of the video for light this one is also pretty viable maybe even more viable in terminal attack which is rank mode I don't think anyone is playing terminal attack so I don't know how relevant this is it's still good in quick cash but it's probably better in T8 let me get into it that is of course the sniper light massive fan of the sniper light this season um they didn't really change anything with the sniper light but the fmal bore so yeah the Firma boore the addition of the Firma boore allows you to open up a little bit more angles it allows you to like break holes either like nearby they can shoot out of or break holes if the enemies are BN you know bunched up inside of a house or either from the ceiling or just from a wall really far away for this game in the background I decided to just go for a just sniping people as far away as possible and it was just really fun again the sniper is unchanged but it's still really fun so to go with the sr84 I would go with a grappling hook you can run the dash but I feel like it's unnecessary uh just get the grappling hook you can get cool Widowmaker shots you can disengage really well out on high grounds on low grounds and get up on the cranes or whatever so you can get Vantage points much more easily uh again yeah Sr you want the sr84 you want a fmob boore then you want this one is a bit of a dealer's Choice personally I would say glitch grenade is the best choice as far as grenades go because you can break Shields with it and as of the end of season 2 The Glitch grenade now hits if there's a lot of shields in one place it's still AOE uh it's going to take down all shields in the surrounding area and they're just going to break for more glitch grenade very valuable you can replace this with a gas grenade or even pyro grenade if you want just to Zone enemies out but usually your teammates should have that part covered it's up to you uh whether you believe your teammates can do that or not and finally we have of course the Gateway for light which is no surprise I just think this thing is neat maybe not as good for Sniper light as you would want it might be good to just set up a Gateway on a vantage point somewhere and then you go to another vantage point and if you get pushed you can just make a Gateway and do a quick getaway it's completely up to you a lot of ways you can use it it is again a very versatile Gadget that all lights probably should use I copied your heavy setup and it absolutely smacks it's so [Â __Â ] good it is genuinely it it is scary how good it is like all you need to do is believe in yourself and believe in the me that believes in you and then would you you will just destroy right you will just just destroy completely but it's all about mind games and confidence to do it but those were nine loadouts if you guys enjoyed the nine loadouts hit the like hit the Subscribe uh and uh let me know if they work well for you and if you want to learn more check out the video on the screen we have a weapons tier list that's right we have an ability one coming out and some more cool stuff coming out because we've been pumping a lot of season fre content don't you guys miss it okay byebye,"The text provided does not contain any specific information or opinions on the CL-40 grenade launcher for the game 'The Finals'. The reviewer discussed two weapon loadouts including the LH1 Invis Glitch Gateway and the SH1 1900 Cloak, praising both for their effectiveness in-game. Unfortunately, there is no mention of the CL-40 grenade launcher or any commentary on weapon balancing in the text provided. The player suggests that the CL-40 grenade launcher is extremely viable, especially when used with the 'cloak' feature. They recommend pairing it with a stun gun due to the stun gun's significant buffs. They also see a great deal of benefit in using the Gateway for its versatility and viability. The player also suggests that the xp54, which deals consistent damage across all ranges, is a good alternative to the CL-40, especially when coming out of cloak due to the scope that aids in target acquisition. The player believes that the CL-40, stun gun, and Gateway all complement each other well in a loadout, and strongly recommends this combination.

Unfortunately, the player doesn't provide an in-depth analysis on the balancing of the CL-40 grenade launcher. However, from their comments, it can be inferred that they believe it to be a powerful weapon, particularly when paired with the right accessories and strategies. They do not mention any issues with the weapon being overpowered or underpowered. 

In the continuing discussion about medium class gameplay, the player mentions some changes to the meta and kit that might have affected the viability of some playstyles, but the specific relationship to the CL-40 grenade launcher is unclear without further context. The provided text doesn't contain any specific opinions or feedback regarding the CL-40 grenade launcher weapon in the game 'The Finals'. It discusses other weapons and tactics, such as the use of an AKM or F Car for sustained damage and the utility of a defibrillator, but no mention is made of the CL-40. Therefore, I'm unable to extract any opinions about this weapon. The opinion on the CL-40 grenade launcher is not explicitly mentioned in the text provided. However, it is suggested that the grenade could be used to get a bit of opening damage, especially when the player doesn't have a lot of range. The decision to use the grenade is said to depend on the player's preference and their team's strategy. It seems to be considered a viable choice for the last slot in the gadgets, especially for the movement medium class, but the text also mentions the option to go with defibrillators instead due to the competitive nature of the 'World Tour'.

Additionally, it's worth noting that the text discusses strategies for using the SA 1216 heavy with the winch, which can be used to pull in and kill an enemy. The winch can be particularly effective against a previous heavy meta of double heavy medium with lots of shields, as it can pull the enemy out of position. However, the SA 1216 is described as not hitting super hard, implying that its damage output might be somewhat lacking. The text mentions a technique where the winch animation cancels the reload of the SA 1216, which might make it stronger in a certain sense. However, it seems that other loadouts might be more effective. The user's opinion on the CL-40 grenade launcher isn't explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, various opinions are shared on other weapons and tactics in the game 'The Finals'. 

The user mentions several combinations and strategies involving the winch claw and the sledgehammer, stating that there are many combos that can be executed with this pairing that cannot be achieved with any other weapon. For example, they mention that pulling a light character with the winch claw then hitting them with a left click and then a melee attack can result in an instant kill. The same strategy can also effectively kill medium characters with a right-click attack. 

The winch claw's strength against heavy characters isn't as profound, though the user still suggests a tried and true strategy of right-click, left-click, and then a melee cancel. 

A strategy involving the barricade is also mentioned, where it can be used to block line of sight and give an advantage in combat. Especially with heavy characters, the user suggests placing the barricade and then climbing it to get the drop on an enemy. 

The RPG is mentioned as effective for long-range damage or for blasting light or medium characters, particularly after a pull with the winch claw. 

The Dome shield is noted for providing additional shields and is dubbed ""very strong"". 

Overall, the user seems to appreciate the tactical depth and variety of strategies available in 'The Finals', though no specific opinion on the CL-40 grenade launcher is provided in this The user seems to have a high opinion of multiple weapons and their combinations in the game 'The Finals', but unfortunately, there's no specific mention or opinion about the CL-40 grenade launcher. The user mentions a few weapons and strategies, including the combo RPG for destruction and damage, the Dome Shield for additional health, the M60 (also known as Rambo Heavy) for its charge and slam feature, and the L gun which has been negatively affected by a recent patch, according to the player. However, without any specific references to the CL-40 grenade launcher, it's impossible to extract an opinion about this weapon from the given text. This player seems to have an overall positive opinion about the CL-40 grenade launcher in 'The Finals'. They mention that it's fun to use, particularly in a more aggressive or ""Rambo"" play style. The player appreciates the weapon's ability to break down shields and barricades quickly, and suggests that it gives them an edge over other players, especially in confrontations with 'Heavies', likely referring to characters or units with high health or armor.

The player also praises the grenade launcher's range of destruction and its synergy with the Dome Shield, which apparently gives the player character additional health. This combo seems to enhance the player's survivability and ability to control the battlefield.

However, the player does not specifically discuss the balance of the CL-40 grenade launcher, so it's unclear whether they believe it's overpowered, underpowered, or appropriately balanced compared to other weapons in the game. The player's enthusiasm for the weapon suggests they may find it powerful or at least enjoyable to use, but they don't explicitly compare it to other weapons for balance. From the given text, it seems the player has a favorable opinion of the Glitch Grenade, a weapon similar to the CL-40 grenade launcher in the game 'The Finals'. They appreciate its ability to break shields, especially when there are many shields in one place, due to its Area of Effect (AOE) damage. They also suggest that it can be replaced with a gas grenade or a pyro grenade for zoning enemies out, but they leave it up to the player's discretion, depending on their trust in their teammates.

They also mention the Gateway for light, which they find neat and versatile for all light class players. There's a strategy suggestion of setting it up on a vantage point for a quick escape route.

They generally express a positive opinion about the game's weapon setup, stating that it's excellent and even scary how good it is. They emphasize the importance of self-confidence and strategic play. Lastly, they encourage feedback and interaction from their audience, asking them to like, subscribe, and share their experiences using the discussed loadouts.

However, there are no specific opinions given on the CL-40 grenade launcher. This could be due to the weapon not being mentioned or used in their discussed loadouts."
The Finals best weapons season 3,C_lFXLszONY,The BEST and WORST Weapons In The Finals Season 3,that's good all right the rest of them we don't even care about all right melee weapons every single one of them dog [Â __Â ] tier absolutely horrible weapons and I'll explain to you why Hammer is good it's B tier plus I'll explain to you why why the Mele weapons are not good okay number one the balancing for melee weapons will never be good and here's the reason you've only got two or three variables to change on melee weapons to make them Balan verus if you take any of these other guns like the MP5 the lh1 whatever it might be any of these automatic guns you're able to change the fire rate the optic the mag size the damage per shot the damage range falloff Etc right The Recoil you're able to change all those things but when it comes to melee weapons the only thing you can do is swing speed and damage and that's that's pretty much all you can change there's not much else you could do cuz the the character speeds are already set at what class you pick so that doesn't even really matter so for that reason all the melee weapons are dark [Â __Â ] tier not to mention they have pretty much no versatility right so in ranked you're going to use one of these weapons and basically never be able to do anything because you don't have the versatility you have to sit in a corner and kind of just like pray for the best so melee weapons dog [Â __Â ] moving on let's go to an S tier weapon the MP5 for light this gun's insane you guys have been seeing me play light the past few weeks I basically transitioned from a full-time medium player to a full-time light player that's crazy isn't it I used to hate on lights too but the MP5 it has no recoil I cannot even stress that enough it literally does not move like the gun has no recoil at any range its fire rate is insane the damage is absolutely insane especially if you're up close and the Damage range falloff really not that bad not to mention it's got an optic one of the few guns in the game to have an optic so that alone puts it up in the S tier yeah that gun's great let's look at we could get controversial I mean I mean we could get controversial where do I want to put this next weapon let me think about this oh while I think about it we forgot a melee weapon yes the riot shield is dog [Â __Â ] and that's and that's what it is that's the truth but let me think about where I want to put this next weapon here man okay I got to be fair I'm going to put this in D tier maybe it would be C tier but because of my bias and how much I hate the GL I'm putting it in D tier and I'm going to put the heavy one in F tier the reason being the medium GL blows up on contact whereas the heavy one does not so I find this one a little more difficult to use I think the medium gl's a lot easier to use a little more consistent but here's the reason they're so low all right I'm tempted to put them in the dog [Â __Â ] tier because let's be honest that's what these weap arm right chat says no GL is good listen regardless of how good or bad the weapon is I think everybody here can agree that especially if you're a light player or really any player it is the most annoying thing to run against gl's running turrets it's just the most annoying if you're a light player you can actually die like two shots you just insta die you literally in to die like I'm playing casual and I run into a triple GL with turrets and it's like dear God bro like God forbid one of these guys like accidentally hit me while they're just like wildly spraying into the air like hoping something happens just for me to uncloak get caught by their three turrets and get melted literally melted bro so for that reason I'm putting these in dnf they are low skill weapons very low skill weapons if you if you main one of the gl's I hate to break it to you but you might want to try Minecraft moving on here we go we just keep getting controversial with it let's do another controversial one let me think where I want to put the sniper at let me think about this objectively you would have to say the sniper like a tier objectively speaking B Bas on its damage and all of that but realistically speaking this is a dog [Â __Â ] gun now maybe you could argue it would be D or F tier but I'm going to put it in dog [Â __Â ] tier and here's why this gun is the most frustrating thing to play of all time to play against I mean I know you guys have played it especially in Powers shift you're sitting there on the point trying to move it and there's a sniper on top of the crane or on top of the cathedral a th000 met away Chris Kyle sniping your [Â __Â ] boom 230 HP gone now you got to heal up now you got to wait 10 seconds now you have to wait 10 seconds to get your HP back God forbid you're playing terminal attack which is the new rank Game Mode God forbid that because you know for sure the sniper is going to Grapple up to the highest point in the map I don't know if you guys have seen any footage of to the new map but there's a giant Tower in the middle that overlooks the whole map bro you already know you're playing terminal attack on the new game mode the sniper spawns in the first thing he does is grapple up to the tower boom 115 every every single shot he hits at minimum 115 maybe 230 God forbid you took 20 damage on medium your ass is dead randomly God forbid you're on light that [Â __Â ] was a stake you've only got 150 HP you're just instad dead so this gun does not fit the finals it has no place in this game this game is like a fast-paced shooter this this gun has no place in the finals it doesn't make sense especially with the direction they're pushing the game in with terminal attack and uh you know power shift these game modes they're introducing the sniper doesn't make sense it doesn't even make sense in the traditional Cash Out game mode and that's because realistically the sniper is not that good up close like it could be really frustrating like getting hipfire head shot by a sniper up close but realistically like it's only a problem from range so in cash out you're never with your team the sniper player is always on the last place Team all the time all right let's move on to some more positive guns here Chad's talking about the revolver big Johnson says revolver is D tier nah there's there's no way the revolver F back flips on it what's up Joe I think the revolver goes let me think I was typing in your chat hold on the revolver goes B tier and the revolver goes B tier I think because while it could be really good and you can absolutely shred people the problem is you have to be really good you have to be like extremely good and you don't have a very high M capacity so even if you are really good often times especially in cash out ranked you're just going to die Chad says C tier I could see C tier you know we'll go C tier I think you're right I think moving it to C tier makes more sense all right moving on the weapon I played the most with in the finals the F car now I'm going to put the F car in here even even with all the Nerfs recently I see a lot of people talking about how difficult The Recoil is look up a recoil smoothing video maybe I'll make one subscribe to the channel maybe I'll make a recoil tutorial but the F car is easily s tier for multiple reasons number one it's just it's just a good like traditional AR it it does good damage the fire rates yeah it's all right but it does good damage The Recoil if you do recoil smoothing there is no recoil and with the optic it's one of the few guns in the game with an optic easily s tier purely because of that Chad says it's a tier because it doesn't have a lot of ammo trust me you've got enough ammo to take out your opponents let me tell you it only has five less bullets than the MP5 which is also s tier and the MP5 shoots much faster meaning you could theoretically miss your shots way easier just hit your shots exactly the F car is easily s here easily s here let's move on to the the other medium gun that I see people using all the time the AK I'm going to put the AK a tier the only thing stopping the AK from being an S tier is it doesn't have an optic that's the only thing that is causing me to place it in a tier it's a pretty fun gun but I just I don't find myself killing people as easily as I do with the F car so if it had an optic I'd probably use it way more moving on let's look at the model we do another medium gun we're going through him the model is definitely where should the model go definitely s or a let me see I'm going to say it's a tier I'm going to say it's a tier right now chat says b tier a tier I think it's a tier you don't quite have the versatility that I would like uh like for example if you had an automatic AR you're kind of limited on Range so you need to position yourself better and if you're positioning yourself differently than you would normally that means your team kind of has to position position themselves differently as well that way you guys aren't split apart so because this gun doesn't have great versatility I'm going to put it at a tier but I don't think I really if this if this shotgun was s tier I'd probably be losing my mind I would probably lose in my mind absolutely all right let's do some heavy weapons the flamethrower man I'm gonna put the flamethrower in D tier it's not quite F tier I think it's okay it deals decent damage and the burn is is really annoying like he can shoot you pull up his shield and then he's fully shielded while you're just taking damage so a good flamethrower player they'll either use like the goo gun and trap you and burn you to death I made a video on that before or they'll just tap you with the fire and then pull up their mesh shield and then essentially you're just taking damage while they're shielded now I'm putting it low because again it lacks versatility you've got short range and for that I think it it limits what you can do in game definitely not to mention I think it's a pretty low skill weapon let's be honest it's a pretty low skill weapon All Right Moving On let's do another heavy weapon the M60 D tier I know a lot of people have been saying recently that the M60 is is buffed or it's good or it's better than the ls gun for whichever reasons but I'll be honest with you the M60 is trash the iron sights not my favorite The Recoil it feels it feels like there's way more recoil on the M60 than there is on the ls gun maybe I'm just not used to it but the extra ma capacity does not mean anything to me when I can kill a whole team of three with the Lew gun still it doesn't matter so this is going D tier let's see what's next we got some light guns let's try to get these light guns out of here lh1 a tier the only reason this gun wouldn't be higher is because of the visual recoil and no optic but honestly if this thing had an optic and The Recoil was super low it would be it would be probably like the best gun in the game but because of the visual recoil it's kind of hard to use especially with the iron sights so as good as good as it is it's going to stay a tier the M11 I'm actually going to go C tier because I'm comparing it right now to some of the other light guns and the M11 is one that I just would not pick over several other light guns I know it has more ammo than the MP but honestly I find myself needing way more bullets to kill a single person maybe it's because it has iron sights or The Recoil is weird or it does less damage I don't know what it is but I can kill people with the with the MP5 way faster than I can with the M11 so I'm I'm placing it C tier the pistol for light chat is saying D tier absolutely not bro this thing is B tier you throw that alien skin on there you throw that Ray Gun skin on there this [Â __Â ] just went up to a tier somehow if you don't have that skin though it's probably around B tier but this thing does a lot of damage its range is pretty decent and it actually has a ton of ammo I actually really like this pistol I don't have much more to say about it but the pistol's pretty good definitely not as good as like the MP5 but not that bad I would probably run I would probably run run the pistol before I run ran the L1 simply because I'm not good with the lh1 the pistol is way easier to use all right let's get one more heavy gun lison s tier range is pretty good The Recoil is a bit rough if you're comparing it to some of the other guns here but to be honest this is definitely probably the best heavy Weapon It's got more versatility than the shotgun good range good damage good Max size and the reload really isn't that bad especially for an lmg so that's definitely going to be S let's do the last Light gun the shotgun I think we're putting the [Music] shotgun realistically speaking C tier you can you can play really really good with the double barrel and you can maybe argue B tier but I'm trying to think when I place these weapons from the perspective of rank and in ranked sure I've had I've even had games where I played good with it but at the end of the day is it better than the MP5 or is it is it more versatile than the pistol I don't think so I've got longer range with the pistol I've got more ammo I could take out multiple targets I can't quite do that with the shotgun so I think if the pistol's B tier then the shotgun has to be C tier and that just leaves us with a heavy shotgun honestly I'm kind of conflicted on where to put this I think we'll put it a tier it was definitely s tier especially in season one but it's had some Nerfs and I do think the meta will evolve eventually where just aping on top of people with a jump pad is not going to work there will be some like Gadget or specialization or something the players will evolve and counter the the current like shotgun meta and when they do you'll need more versatility so I think that puts the L gun above it so there you have it the finals tier list missing three guns am I missing three guns yeah so we're missing three guns chat all right chat it's not quite the end of the tier list just yet I forgot we had three more guns oh boy bamas uh um God damn the Famas bro really like is this even serious God damn I'm placing it C tier dude I'm going to be real nice to Oscar today and place that [Â __Â ] in C tier but don't even get me started on the Famas bro that's one of the worst guns I've ever seen heavy shotgun the slug shotgun guys I'm gonna be honest this is f tier it's almost dog [Â __Â ] tier but I'm not going to lie I think it's F tier this thing is so bad like even if you have good aim it's like projectile based so you just miss like you'll be right your crossair will be right on them and you just miss it just feels horrible to use this gun feels so bad oh my God this pistol Jesus man I've used this like two times on light in my whole life so I was using it and I was like damn like I can't even kill another light with this thing bro pistol's definitely F tier the worst light gun for sure by far well I guess I guess I do have the sniper below it but that's for different reasons that's for different reasons so that's my tier list let me know what you guys think I think I did pretty good I know we're going to get a lot of angry melee players in the comments talking about how the the sledgehammer and the katana need to be higher but I'll be honest with you guys those are cheese weapons man we're playing a first- person shooter not a first person melee game this ain't for Honor this is the finals,"The speaker expressed a negative opinion about all melee weapons in the game 'The Finals' citing poor balancing and lack of versatility as the main issues. According to the speaker, melee weapons have only two variables that can be changed: swing speed and damage, which limits their ability to be balanced compared to guns. The speaker also mentioned that melee weapons have no versatility and are not suitable for ranked play.

The speaker didn't mention the CL-40 grenade launcher in the provided text. However, they did express a positive opinion about the MP5 for light class. They praised this weapon for its lack of recoil, high fire rate, and high damage. The speaker also noted that the MP5 is one of the few guns in the game to have an optic, which is a major advantage. The speaker's transition from playing as a medium player to a light player was largely due to the MP5's performance in the game. The speaker expresses strong negative opinions about the CL-40 grenade launcher in ""The Finals"" game. They believe the weapon deserves a D-tier ranking, potentially even lower. They explain that while the medium grenade launcher (GL) detonates on impact, making it somewhat easier to use than the heavy one, they still find it an annoying and low-skill weapon. They go as far as saying that users of the GL might be better suited to less competitive games, suggesting Minecraft as an alternative.

They describe the GL as particularly frustrating for light players, who can be killed in as few as two shots, and they express significant annoyance at the combination of GLs and turrets. They depict a scenario in which they uncloak, only to be immediately targeted by three turrets and killed, suggesting that GL users don't need to aim accurately but can just spray shots into the air hoping to hit something. This leads them to label GLs as ""low skill weapons.""

Despite their harsh criticism, they acknowledge that some people in the chat argue that the GL is a good weapon. However, they stick to their opinion that regardless of its effectiveness, it's an irritating weapon to contend with. The text provided doesn't seem to include specific feedback about the CL-40 grenade launcher weapon in 'The Finals'. However, there are detailed opinions about another weapon type, presumably a sniper rifle. The player complains that the sniper rifle is frustrating to play against. Particularly in game modes like Powers shift and Terminal Attack, where the sniper's high damage output and long range pose a serious problem. The player also criticizes the sniper's ability to grapple to high vantage points, which gives them an unfair advantage. The player believes that the fast-paced nature of the game is incompatible with the sniper's mechanics, suggesting that it doesn't fit in 'The Finals'. The player also mentions that the sniper is not effective in close combat, which seems to be its only drawback. In the provided text, there's no discussion about the CL-40 grenade launcher. The conversation revolves around several weapons including the revolver, the F car, and the MP5, but there isn't any specific mention or opinion about the CL-40 grenade launcher in the game 'The Finals'. The review indicates that the AK weapon might have been placed in the A tier due to the lack of an optic feature. The reviewer finds the weapon fun but believes it performs less effectively than the F car. If the AK had an optic, the reviewer would use it more frequently. 

The Model, another medium gun, was placed in the A tier. It was suggested the weapon lacks versatility, specifically in terms of range, which requires strategic positioning from the user and their team. Despite these limitations, if the shotgun were in the S tier, the reviewer would be overly excited. 

The reviewer has placed the Flamethrower in the D tier. Despite its decent damage and burning effect, the weapon is criticized for its lack of versatility and short range. Furthermore, the reviewer describes it as a low skill weapon. The user can employ tactics such as using the goo gun to trap and burn enemies or shooting fire and then shielding.

The Finals best weapons season 3,MYXqrJBdfWQ,The Finals - New Weapons (Season 3),"DefTech 1315 , United States, 37mm Recurve Bow ,United States, Arrow Katana (Short, Dual Wield) Spear","Analyzing community opinion on the mentioned weapons, the consensus is as follows:

1. CL-40 Grenade Launcher: This weapon has a mixed reception. Some players appreciate the high damage output and range, finding it suitable for clearing out large groups of enemies. However, other players feel that it's overpowered, especially in close-quarter combat scenarios where the splash damage can be devastating. Some players have suggested reducing either the splash damage radius or the overall damage to balance it out. Overall, the CL-40 Grenade Launcher is seen as a strong choice for those preferring explosive weapons.

2. DefTech 1315: The DefTech 1315 is a popular choice among players due to its versatility. It's praised for its balance between power and speed, and the ability to switch between different ammo types is well-liked. Some players feel it could use a minor boost to its range, but overall, it's well-regarded.

3. 37mm Recurve Bow: This weapon has a niche following. Players who enjoy the challenge and reward of a precision-based weapon favor the 37mm Recurve Bow. Despite its high damage and the satisfaction of nailing a long-range shot, the steep learning curve and slow rate of fire have been a deterrent for some players.

4. Arrow Katana (Short, Dual Wield): The Arrow Katana has been generally well received, especially among players who favor melee combat. Its speed and high damage output, particularly when dual wielded"

pleasure as well man take it easy,"The speaker expresses mixed opinions on the CL-40 grenade launcher in the game 'The Finals'. They note that the weapon can be effective against light class characters, or ""light repellent"", but suggests that it is less useful in other scenarios. They describe it as ""mid"", implying it is neither extremely good nor bad. They also mention that it can be paired decently with movement, however, they do not elaborate on this. The speaker also suggests a need for team-orientated play when using this weapon, though they do not directly link this to the grenade launcher. They don't mention any specific issues with weapon balancing regarding the CL-40 grenade launcher. The overall opinion on the weapon seems to be lukewarm, with the speaker acknowledging some benefits but also limitations of the weapon. Based on the text, it's not easy to extract detailed opinions about weapon balancing or the CL-40 grenade launcher for the game 'The Finals' as the player isn't specifically commenting on these aspects. The player talks about different situations in the game, the challenge of the final round, the importance of having competent teammates, and difficulty with certain parts of the map. 

There are references to grenade launchers being ""hurt down there stairs"" which might suggest that the player feels the grenade launchers, possibly including the CL-40, can be challenging to use in certain situations or locations, like stairs. The player also comments ""the debris is what blocked the last shot,"" which could be interpreted as frustration about environmental aspects of the game interfering with the use of weapons like the CL-40 grenade launcher.

It seems to be effective against 'lights', possibly referring to lighter, less armored opponents, but not much else. They also mention using it in combination with a 'mine', suggesting that this weapon might be more suitable for strategic plays rather than direct confrontations. However, they seem to manage to effectively use the weapon in certain situations, as they mention making some successful 'picks' and 'kills' with it. Overall, it seems like the user finds the CL-40 grenade launcher to be somewhat underpowered or limited in its usefulness."
The Finals Medium Class guide,J4hY5VI-IN0,Medium Builds and Strategies - The Finals Guides / How to Guides Season 3,medium being the in between pick doesn't have the more apparent advantages that come with having the largest Health pool like heavy or highest damage output like light stat-wise it's middle of the ground in every way average Mobility average Health average damage so it makes sense for someone that knows nothing about the game to dismiss Medium as a class or contestant that has no advantages to offer and rather choose between the high health and high defensive capabilities of heavy or the high damage and high mobility of light depending on their preferred play style just looking at basic numbers medium might appear to be a class that serves no purpose but anyone that's actually played the finals knows that's not true what separates each class more than just the numbers are their specializations and gadgets and when throwing these into the mix the class's identities become much more distinct as of season 3 medium has three specializations that in my mind create three distinctively different play styles to choose from there's a supportive SL healer option a defensive SL lockdown option and what I'd call a more Mobility SL damage focused option all of which I think are viable ways to play if they're paired with the right gadgets my three strategies may not Encompass all possible play Styles but it's what comes to mind when I see each specialization you you may have your own strategies that differ from mine the builds and strategies I'll be going over are made considering cash out as a primary game mode but two of these builds can also work in terminal attack my preferred play style and the one I'd like to highlight first is the supportive option this play style involves using the healing beam as your specialization along with at least two supportive gadgets we'll consider the third Gadget slot to be a flexible slot that can vary from round to round and this will be true for all of our builds the gadgets you'd want for this play style are ones that support your team in some way the no-brainer choice is the defib and to be honest I think the defib is such a great Gadget that it's hard not to put in every medium build and the second supportive Gadget is the jump pad it's a quick to place Gadget that anyone on your team can use and it comes in handy for the support strategy that I'll explain in a bit an alternative to the jump pad is of course the zip line which serves a similar purpose a preference for the jump pad over the zip line simply comes from the fact that the jump pad is faster to place and you don't move in a forced slow and predictable path like you would with the zip line although there are places that can be too high or too far away to reach with the jump pad making the zip line necessary at times for my Flex Gadget I usually default a frag grenade cuz I like to have throwables but depending on the situation glitch traps are a great choice I'd use glitch traps in situations where I'm playing against a lot of lights with cloaking device or evasive Dash or even against other mediums that are using healing beam and defib since those are the players that rely the most on having their specialization at the ready and one good trap can ruin their day other than that this is the one slot that can be used for whatever you'd like the strategy for the support play style is that you want to be more of a follower going along with your team wherever they'd like to go and keeping a close eye on them without physically being too close to them ideally if your group is dying you want to be the the last one down because you should be the one keeping them up it can be a bit tricky switching back and forth from playing this way and playing as if you don't have the heal beam since you have to remind yourself that your team should be doing most of the heavy lifting in the damage compartment and you should be behind them they're off to the side keeping them alive as you're following it's best to prioritize shooting at the same targets as your team and centure behind them this should mean you'll generally be taking less damage in fights and you'll be able to see your team's Health to know when a fight is going south and you need to switch to your healing beam the most important thing to note about playing with the healing beam as your specialization is that if you're healing someone there's no need need for you to be out in the open as well while they're taking damage if there's an opportunity to sit behind some form of cover while you're healing then do it there's no value in standing somewhere where you can get shot and you can't fight back knowing when to switch off of your weapon to your healing beam and taking a back seat is the key to making this play style work it comes from deciding in the moment whether it would be more beneficial to heal in a given situation or if it would be more beneficial to damage now as far as why the gadgets I mentioned work well at this play style is that the defib obviously can revive people making it ideal for a Healer and support Focus strategy and I don't think it needs much more EXP than that as far as the jump pad or zip line other than being a gadget that everyone on your team can use it's also just a great repositioning tool for you when as I described earlier you're healing and don't want to be standing out in the open it can help you reposition to a distance that still works with the healing beam while also giving you a good vantage point to help in fights from a distance which brings us to our ideal weapon choices if you're playing from a distance doesn't make sense to use weapons that don't have any range so weapons like the riot shield or dual blades just aren't a good fit for this play style but I won't say there's any Perfect Weapon choice so just choose what you like what makes this my preferred play style for medium is that it's only possible to play this way on medium medium is the only contestant in the game that can heal their team and's the only one that can perform an instant revive maybe others will be able to do this stuff in the future but we'll have to wait and see whereas you can argue that the other strategies that I'll be describing can be mimicked to an extent by the other two classes now onto my second play style the defensive or lock down option involves picking the guardian turret of course and defending the objective whether you're playing cash out or terminal attack it's much easier to set this up in terminal Tech during the defense pre-round phase but other than it being more difficult in cash out or on the offensive side of terminal attack to set up the play style remains pretty much unchanged the gadgets you'd want to use are gadgets that are ideal for locking down an objective most importantly gas mines gas mines are what I'd say are the best of the mines to use for this lock down play style and I'll go into more detail as to why when discussing the overall strategy our second Gadget will also be mines but this time it's a choice between explosive mines or glitch trps between the two I usually gravitate towards explosive mines because I prefer the extra damage over the ability denial and combined with the turret and gas mines you can end up getting eims sometimes without even having to do anything as I said for the build the third slot is your choice but as I also said it's hard for me not to choose the defib since there's no other alternative to what it can do that being said there are some other good choices here such as the aps turret to help protect your setup or the other set of Mines that you didn't choose for your second slot now the strategy that I find most effective for locking down an objective is placing your gas mines on the objective itself just in case it ends up shifting around or being dropped to another floor the gas not only provides more area denial for a lockdown build but also denies your opponents from taking the objective even if your team gets wiped if your opponents don't have a way to counter the gas this could be potentially waste five or more seconds of their time depending on when each mine gets triggered also take into consideration that it takes about 5 seconds for a Cash Out Steel to finish and you're adding extra waste of time on top of that with these gas mines to make matters worse for your opponent the added annoyance from the guardian turret and another set of Mines can make stealing an objective feel hopeless for explosive mind placements I found the best spots are right after someone turns a corner since this game can be really fast-paced especially when you're playing right on an objective most people aren't going to be taking the time to clear Corners before running in and I find more success placing them this way than at entry points like I more commonly see them placed with glitch shaps you should be more concerned about placing them in spots to cover as much area as possible and keep in mind that you don't have to place them in spots that people tend to walk in order to activate them with how they work now as far as turret placement goes priority number one is that it needs to be in a spot that covers as much of the room as possible and priority number two is that you want it in a spot where it's hard to get a good angle to destroy it a good placement is a balance between the two protecting an indoor objective is easier but this strategy can work with an outdoor objective as well just not as great turret has pretty great range and if you're placing gas mines on the actual objective as I described this can be enough to keep it locked down it's a lot trickier to place your other set of mins but it's better to place them than to not as far as weapon choices the only one that I might stay away from is the cl40 just to not accidentally blow up any Minds I normally stick to ARS on medium but in theory the riot shield can work really well with this play style the only downside being when you don't have an objective you're locking down you're now stuck with a weapon that has no range a good alternative would be the model 1887 which has a surprising amount of range but it's still most effective from short to medium distances My overall opinion on this play style is that while it's great I tend to be too impatient at times to want to sit in the room with the objective waiting for people to push in so if you have a similar problem maybe try one of the other two play Styles instead okay now this last play style I haven't quite refined but I'd like to at least paint a picture of how it should work if played right it can be just as devastating as the other builds but it also has what I believe to be the biggest gap between skill floor and ceiling you'll be using the dematerializer as your specialization basically creating a build that makes you have extremely high area damage this build can also act as a counter to the lock down play style or any other team that's playing highly defensively the first first Gadget is going to be the frag grenade or pyro grenade and these are essential for tying this Build Together second will be explosive mines or gas mines but if you're using pyro grenades steer clear of using gas mines with them and your third Gadget can be a mine or throwable as well the defib or anything else you'd like but more mines or throwables would technically better complete the build the strategy is that you should be popping in and out of fights using the dematerializer to accomplish this and get a surprise angle or a quick escape on your opponents as you open your window with a dematerializer or find an existing opening for your surprise angle you'll have the opportunity to use a frag or pyro followed by your mind the frags with explosive minds work best for this strategy cuz if executed perfectly you can instantly delete someone or get them extremely low the frag will act as a Detonator for your mind rather than relying on the inconsistency of it getting tripped naturally you can also use the pyrro grenade as an alternative to the frag as a Detonator although it's a bit slower it's important to do this in the exact order I mentioned because the throwables take longer to throw than a mine takes the place saving you time and making it more difficult to get out of when doing it this way this is hard to pull off because you generally only get one opportunity to catch someone by surprise during a fight and swapping between your specialization two gadgets and then back to your weapon is a lot of inputs in a short time then of course if they move too much either only one or nothing will hit which is why this is great when playing against defensive teams chances are they'll have something placed down that can cause a chain reaction if you miss with your throwable while this can technically be done with any specialization being able to create an opening of your own means you can do this with more success than running into an existing opening and trying to toss a frag in mine at someone and since medium doesn't have any real ways to destroy walls other than the dematerializer at the moment it makes it the best choice if you're pulling off a quick escape the same thing can be done if your opponent tries to chase it catches people almost every time of course your priority should be to try and cut them off by closing a wall you've opened so they can't chase in the first place but if they do make it through you'll be ready tossing a throwable at your feet and then placing a mine shortly after Works nearly every time one of them will almost always hit this is way more consistent than the surprise angle it makes this build the best for personal survivability this build is centered around trying to wipe out a Target without giving them much of an opportunity to fight back which sounds great on paper but it is extremely difficult to pull off consistently I'm sure with enough practice ice though someone is going to get great at this if you prefer area denial over the high damage frag explosive mine combo then gas mines work better or pyrro grenades with explosive mines weapons of choice for this build are similar to The lockdown build anything works but unlike the lockdown build you want to blow up your mines so if the cl40 ever ends up getting a buff it would be absolutely deadly with this build the skill cing for this build is extremely high since a dematerializer is a very quick thinking specialization that requires a bit of creativity and you have to look at the maps and walls in a completely different way plus as I mentioned earlier swapping between your specialization two gadgets and your weapon it's a lot to do in a short time span I haven't used this build enough to claim I'm good at it but I know it can work better than I'm showcasing in this video to me medium specializes in filling in the gaps your team has whether that's a lack of Defense a lack of offense or a lack of support to tie your team together cuz more important than your own build Synergy is how well you're playing with your team despite medium's lack of High stats and health or damage you can make up for it with how you choose to play different players will gravitate towards a different one of these builds and because medium offers a taste of the other two classes with the defensive lockdown build and the ability damage build plus it has its own completely unique play style medium in my opinion is the best starter pick for anyone new trying to get into the game thanks for watching,"This text does not provide specific opinions about the CL-40 grenade launcher in the game 'The Finals'. However, it does provide an analysis of the medium class, indicating that while it doesn't excel in any one area, it offers versatility and balance. The medium class has three specializations: supportive healer, defensive lockdown, and mobility-focused damage dealer, each catering to different play styles. The player's strategy and gadget choice can further customize these specializations. The mentioned strategies are more suited for the cash out game mode, but two of them can also be used in terminal attack. The supportive play style, which involves the use of a healing beam specialization and supportive gadgets, is highlighted as a preferred method. The user doesn't mention the CL-40 grenade launcher specifically in their opinion. The detailed opinion revolves around support play style, strategies, and the importance of different gadgets such as defib, jump pad, zip line, frag grenade, and glitch traps in the medium class of 'The Finals' game. The user suggests that the defib is almost a must in every medium build due to its effectiveness. They prefer the jump pad over the zip line because it's quicker and less predictable. They also use a frag grenade as their default flex gadget but suggest the use of glitch traps against certain opponents. The user emphasizes the importance of team play and support, suggesting the player should focus on keeping their team alive rather than dealing damage. However, there is no specific mention of the CL-40 grenade launcher or feedback on weapon balancing. The provided text does not contain any specific opinions or details about weapon balancing or the CL-40 grenade launcher in the game 'The Finals'. The text mainly discusses a healing beam strategy and the situational benefits of using defib, jump pad, or zip line gadgets. The player's preferred play style for the medium class is also mentioned. However, no specific information or opinions about the CL-40 grenade launcher or weapon balancing overall are included. The user has not provided specific feedback on the CL-40 grenade launcher for the game 'The Finals'. They only discussed strategies and preferences for different play styles, gadgets, and classes, including the guardian turret, gas mines, explosive mines, glitch traps, and defibrillator. There is no direct opinion or view shared about the weapon balancing or the CL-40 grenade launcher. For a detailed analysis of this weapon, further specific feedback would be required. The user mentions that they tend to avoid the CL-40 grenade launcher in the game 'The Finals'. The reason being, they are cautious about accidentally blowing up mines with its use. The user doesn't provide any other specific feedback or opinions about the CL-40, such as its effectiveness, handling, or balance within the game. They do mention preferring ARs (assault rifles) for medium play and suggest the possible effective use of a riot shield with their play style. The user's strategy appears to rely heavily on tactical use of mines and turrets, and they fear that the explosive nature of the CL-40 could disrupt their strategy. This user seems to have a mixed opinion about the CL-40 grenade launcher and its role within different playstyles in 'The Finals'. They appreciate the high area damage it can offer, especially when used in conjunction with the 'dematerializer' specialization and other explosive gadgets like the frag or pyro grenade. It seems particularly useful when countering defensive playstyles or when used strategically for surprise attacks or quick escapes.

However, they also highlight a significant gap between the skill floor and skill ceiling, indicating that utilizing this weapon effectively may require a high level of skill and strategic thinking. They also discuss the potential inconsistency of relying on mines to be tripped naturally, suggesting a potential balance issue. Instead, they recommend using the frag grenade as a detonator, which may provide a more reliable outcome.

Overall, while they see potential in the use of the CL-40 grenade launcher, they also express some frustration and suggest that it may not be the best choice for those who prefer more straightforward, less strategic gameplay. The CL-40 grenade launcher is regarded as a powerful weapon in the game 'The Finals', with its usage requiring strategic planning and precise timing due to its slower speed compared to other weaponry. The use of this weapon in conjunction with throwables like the pyrro grenade can create significant damage, especially when used against defensive teams who are likely to have placed items that can cause a chain reaction. 

However, the effectiveness of this strategy largely depends on the element of surprise and the player's ability to switch between gadgets and weapons swiftly, which can be challenging. If the opponent moves too much, the damage inflicted could be minimal.

Another aspect of the CL-40 grenade launcher's functionality is its utility in creating an opening or an escape route. This is particularly useful for the medium class, which doesn't have many options for wall destruction apart from the dematerializer. 

The grenade launcher can also be used defensively. If an opponent attempts to pursue, a well-timed throwable and mine placement can deter the chase. This strategy enhances personal survivability and is more consistent than relying on the element of surprise.

Despite the potential advantages, using the CL-40 grenade launcher effectively is acknowledged as being difficult to master. The strategy of wiping out a target without giving them much chance to retaliate sounds ideal in theory, but its execution requires a lot of practice. 

In conclusion, the CL-40 grenade launcher is a versatile weapon that can deliver substantial damage when used skillfully. However, its effectiveness Overall, the opinion on the CL-40 grenade launcher in the game 'The Finals' seems to be quite positive, but with some reservations. Players believe that it has great potential, especially if it were to receive a buff in the future. The high damage frag explosive mine combo makes this weapon an attractive choice for many players, although others suggest that gas mines or pyrro grenades paired with explosive mines might be even more effective.

The CL-40 grenade launcher requires a high level of skill to use effectively, particularly with the dematerializer specialization. This is because it requires quick thinking, creativity and a unique interpretation of the maps and walls in the game. Swapping between your specialization, two gadgets, and your weapon is also noted as being a lot to handle in a short time span.

The medium class, which the CL-40 grenade launcher is a part of, is seen as a versatile option that fills in the gaps in a team, whether that's a lack of defense, offense, or support. The medium class doesn't have high stats in terms of health or damage, but its value comes from the strategic play style it enables. Due to its versatility and unique play style, the medium class is recommended as the best starter pick for anyone new to the game."
The Finals Medium Class guide,7fmHOz7hPqE,The Finals #1 Medium Guide! How To Play Medium PRO Guide,"hello everyone welcome to the video and today we're going to be talking about a full in-depth medium guide for the finals so I have played a lot of medium I've also played a lot of light I made it all the way to Diamond mostly using medium class I only use medium in ranked pretty much because it's just really really good class and um I have a little over 11,000 kills as well with about a 3.2 KD and pretty much all of that is thanks to medium and light and today I'm going to be sharing with you guys a couple of the tips that I've found along the way to help me either rank up keep a high KD or just be as efficient as I can on medium in general so the first thing we're going to talk about is the load out that we're going to be running so it is going to involve Recon senses we're using the F car over the AK it is objectively better in pretty much every way other than mag size so just get good with the car the AK is bad once you start using this SC for so long you'll realize how much better it actually is in the AK and then we have jump pad and defibs which are not negotiable you are going to want to have those in the class no matter what and if you want to swap anything out I would say the frag grenade is the only one you can swap out you can swap it out for the gas mines explosive mines or even the zip line or APS turret but I think frag grenades are great because they work very well with Recon senses when you could see where people are coming from you can pre grenade like entryways and I'll show a couple of these strategies later on but frags just work so well with Recon senses in this game because you know exactly where to throw them and there's no grenade indicator so people don't know when there's a grenade there in a a lot of times they step on them and as for jump pads and defibs they are just absolutely crucial for the medium class and I would very much recommend not changing them out for anything and I'm going to talk about the scar a little bit because it is important to understand the recoil pattern a lot of times people accuse me of having anti-recoil scripts or cheats or whatever the case and it really does feel like it's a new cheat I'm being accused of using every single week but the reality is is that in the finals every single weapon has a 100% consistent recoil pattern so as you'll see on screen right now this is what it looks like when I'm not controlling the F car recoil pattern and this is what it looks like when I am controlling it it still moves around quite a bit and it's nothing too crazy but you can pretty much get the hang of any weapon I mean I've been using the F car for probably I don't know maybe 4,000 of my 11,000 kills have been with just this weapon so it's safe to say I've used it quite a bit and I understand the recoil pattern and it's pretty basic and very easy to control once you get the hang of it so I would h highly recommend to you guys to practice this in the range understand exactly how you're going to be using it and it will benefit you a lot in the long run next thing I want to talk about is a small little micro tip that I found out the other day and that's that you can cancel reloads so as you can see by this animation you can cancel your reload by just pressing your weapon bind for me it's triangle and you just press that whenever you're in a Reload animation it's pretty helpful a lot of times I tend to reload before someone dies and in that situation it's it's pretty helpful now we're going to quickly talk about jump pads jump pads um I feel like this is a very basic tip but sliding into jump pads will make you go farther as well as placing them on a slanted surface will make you go farther as well this is good for roofs in maps like Monaco now we're going to talk about grenades grenades are pretty self-explanatory for the most part but there is a secondary throw animation if you press L2 or right click you will underhand throw a grenade this is great for the stair trick that I'm about to show you essentially when you were running upstairs and if there's someone chasing you you can underhand throw these GR ades depending on how far the enemy is from you if you know they're like right behind you you can throw it up the stairs and they will walk into it or if they're a little bit farther behind you could throw it underhanded of course down the stairs and they will run into it I also show a stair climbing technique on the screen right now which is pretty useful as well for climbing stairs quickly later on in the video I'm also going to show you guys that clip of the grenade where I see people through walls with my Recon senses and I pread the doorway and just kind of wait there and someone steps directly on the nade and end up getting a a pretty free kill because of it and that happens probably multiple times a game where I'm able to do a significant amount of damage or get kills With Grenades so they're very very important to get used to using and now I'm going to talk about Recon senses very quickly because they're very self-explanatory essentially you're just not going to want to waste them so if you know where enemies are and you're not in fights it's probably better off to not be using them Recon senses are very self-explanatory they're literally wall hacks and it's almost hard to use them correctly however another little tip I have for you guys is a lot of times on very bright Maps because the lighting in this game is kind of pitiful but on these very bright Maps it could be kind of difficult to see people and for that reason if you pull out your jump pad screen you can actually inspect it and as you can see by the clip on screen you could see a lot better and um this is a very useful tip for just finding enemies whenever it's too bright on night Maps you don't really have to do this but it can even help probably in those situations as well and last but not least we are just going to talk about the positioning that you're going to want to have when you on medium you are pretty much always going to want to have high ground I mean when you have an AR with so much range so much damage very little damage fallof you have a jump pad that can give you free verticality whenever you want there's no reason for you to not always be abusing High Ground so just make sure you're always positioned on High Ground if you can be you can blow up points so that you have a vantage point above the point and you could shoot down with the scar just make sure you have clear losos and you're just going to be frying people so never leave High Ground don't drop down I do it all the time because I get kill hungry all the time but that's not how you play Medium you're not really going to want to be in 1 V one gunfights with people because sometimes it can be difficult to get out just be in an Untouchable position and be a literal Chopper Gunner but that's pretty much it for today's video If you guys found this video helpful make sure to drop a like as well as a sub about 99% of you guys are not currently subbed so let's make that number a little bit smaller together but again that's it for me so thank you guys again for watching and I'll see you time","The speaker in this transcript has a high opinion of the medium class in the game 'The Finals'. They credit their high kill count and kill-death ratio to the medium and light classes. They specifically endorse the F Car weapon over the AK due to its superior performance in almost all aspects, except for magazine size.

To provide a detailed analysis or opinion on the CL-40 grenade launcher, more specific information about the use and performance of this particular weapon would be necessary. The player seems to find the CL-40 grenade launcher extremely valuable for its strategic uses, particularly when being pursued by enemies. They appreciate the ability to underhand throw grenades, adjusting the throw based on the distance of the enemy. This allows them to set traps for enemies following them up or down stairs, often resulting in free kills.

They also mention the effectiveness of the grenade in combination with the Recon senses, which allow them to see enemies through walls. This combination allows them to anticipate enemy movement and set traps accordingly. The player considers the grenades very important and encourages others to get accustomed to using them.

However, the player criticizes the game's lighting, calling it ""pitiful"" and suggesting it can make spotting enemies difficult on bright maps. They suggest using the jump pad screen to improve visibility.

Finally, they hint at the importance of positioning, but the text cuts off before they provide any specific insights on this topic. Overall, the player seems to view the CL-40 grenade launcher as a potent and versatile weapon, despite some issues with the game's visual design. The text does not provide any specific comments or opinions regarding the weapon balancing or the CL-40 grenade launcher in 'The Finals'. However, it emphasizes the use of high ground advantage and the abuse of verticality in the medium class. The writer also suggests using an AR (Assault Rifle) due to its high damage and range with very little damage falloff. They also mention the use of a jump pad for gaining verticality and a scar for shooting from a vantage point. The text does not endorse engaging in 1v1 gunfights and suggests instead to maintain an untouchable position. It appears the writer may have a preference for a tactical, high-ground approach rather than direct combat in the medium class of the game."
The Finals Medium Class guide,XBN9QUiut4s,The ULTIMATE guide for the MEDIUM CLASS in The Finals!,so the medium class is potentially the most used Class in the finals I obviously don't have the numbers but it is the class I feel like I see the most and it is definitely one of the most crucial when it comes to team play and winning games so today we're going to be going over a fundamental guide on how to play the medium class now I've already done this for the light class and I will be doing it for the heavy class in the next couple of videos so if you are new around here be sure to subscribe for more finals content but with that being said let's get stuck right into it now start stting off with the overall play style you mostly want to sort of consider yourself a support/ medic type of class yet at the same time you are also very solid when it comes to dealing damage and getting kills as well now in my opinion the medium class does take a lot of thought to play properly it's not the type of class you can just equip and then run around and do whatever you want you kind of always have to be on the ball switching between trying to deal damage and push objectives and stuff like that but also constantly changing your mindset at the flea a switch slowing down trying to survive and then healing or Reviving your teammates you almost just have to always be switched on and always be really focused and just have General good awareness if your awareness in this game is not very good then I would honestly recommend picking a different class most likely the heavy class essentially you just need to stay focused on more than just yourself you definitely need to keep all of your teammates in mind knowing pretty much where they are at all times so that you can heal them up and revive them if you need but then also on the flip side of that if all of your focus goes into your teammates and you just sitting there healing your heavy without doing you know any damage yourself that is also not helpful either so it is a bit of a balancing act and it can definitely be a little bit hard to get the hang of compared to some of those other classes now moving on to the I guess load out side of things and starting off with the specialization breakdown I will straight up say it unless one of your teammates has the heel beam and is really good with it you should pretty much always run the heel beam in my opinion yes the turret is very solid to be honest for defending objectives and yes the Recon senses are also really really good for awareness and helping to communicate with your team where the enemies are but in my opinion the heel beam is a clear number one and to be honest even if your teammate has the heal beam as well I think I would still recommend also running the heal beam it is just so clutch especially if you can pair it with someone else using it too you can have essentially unlimited health and that can really help especially if you've got a heavy on your team keeping them constantly alive and just letting them soak up all the damage while you get a few kills and then simply heal them up and get them back to full health now moving on to the weapon side of things it is in my opinion kind of the same situation that I just mentioned I think that at least for me anyway the akm is by far the best of the mediums weapon choices and it is the one that I would definitely recommend at least starting off with and obviously it is the default so I'm going to assume most of you have started off with this weapon now with that being said the fkart is also really good but it is just a little bit more risky if you do miss your shots having only 20 rounds in a magazine that is definitely not handy if you are missing shots and even if you do hit all of your shots you can't really like spray transfer in the same way that you can with an akm where maybe you've taken out one enemy and then you can kind of flick to the next enemy and try and deal a bit of damage most of the time if you are killing an enemy with the F car you pretty much have to reload almost instantly on top of that as well even though the F card definitely deals a bit more damage it does have a slower rate of fire and I'm going to be doing a series where I actually break down all of the stats and stuff for every single weapon but the stats that I do have so far prove that it takes about 34 of your magazine with the fcar to kill a heavy yet it only takes about half of your magazine with the akm to kill a heavy as well even though obviously it takes more bullets with the akm it's still a half of your magazine compared to 34s so that is pretty much a prime example of what I mean that being said it probably sounds like I'm saying the FK is bad it is definitely not it's still very from the use but I do just think the akm is a little bit better as for the other weapon choices I do think that the model 1887 and the r357 are also really solid but but they are just a little bit more Niche I guess so they are more of a personal preference if you really enjoy that type of play style either using a shotgun and getting up close even though that does actually have some really solid range on it or maybe sitting a little bit further back with the r357 then obviously those are still very useful and if that is your play style I would definitely run them as well like I said though I do just feel as though the akm is essentially the Jack of all trades but it isn't the master of none as that saying goes because I do still think it is probably the best weapon in a lot of situations to now moving on to the gadgets and the gadgets that I like to run for the medium class are the gas grenade the defib and the jump Pad but to be honest there are so many good gadgets for the medium class that it is really hard to say the jump pad can be replaced by the zipline for example for a little bit more horizontal movement because obviously the jump pad it is really good for your movement but it is mostly vertical unless you can put it on an angle and then on top of that you can definitely replace your gas grenades for example with any sort of mine or even just the other grenades too or even even the sonar grenade is really solid too for a bit of Team awareness so again it is just down to personal preference but pretty much everything I mentioned there is definitely worth giving a shot and just seeing which ones you like the most but for me it is the gas grenade the defib and the jump pad now the one that you cannot play with though in my opinion is the dpib I would argue that this is the most crucial Gadget in the entire game across all of the three classes and that is especially the case when it comes to tournaments because you obviously have limited revives and so it is an absolute must in the tournaments and especially ranked tournaments too so definitely run with the defib if you're not going to use the defib I would honestly just go ahead and pick a different class to be honest I really see no reason to be playing the medium class unless you are using the defib and like I mentioned before I feel about the same about the heel beam but probably not as strong because the turet is also really good so keep in mind that the medium class is definitely the best because of the de fib and because of that heal beam as well now as for some K tips through remember when you are playing as the medium class the main one is realistically just to stick with your teammates at all times especially when it comes to your heavy or even your other mediums obviously the light class has a little bit more freedom to kind of run off and be a disruptor so often times you just have to let your light player go and let them do their thing but if you're not close to your teammates for example your Heavies and your other mediums you are not nearly as effective one of your strongest points is as I mentioned the heal beam and the ability to very quickly revive teammates and if you're on the other side of the map then obviously that is completely useless so you may as well like I said pick a different class if you are not sticking with your teammates something else that is definitely worth getting in the habit of doing is just constantly healing your teammates at pretty much any chance that you can get if your teammate takes how 20 damage pull your heal beam out heal him switch back to your gun get in the habit of doing that at all times it takes literally like 3 seconds to half heal your teammate's health and then get your gun back out that is going to cause you to win so many more gun fights as a team and once you get to the point where it becomes a habit more than actually something you have to think about it is borderline overpowered in my opinion so definitely get in the habit of doing that it is going to make your teammates absolutely love you and you guys are definitely going to win more games than not now with all of the support Focus aside you still want to try and get your share of kills and damage dealt as well even though that can be a very tough Balancing Act you do still have decent movement as a medium you get stuff like a jump pad for example to increase that even further and so you can can definitely still have that slight little bit of I guess a Slayer role incorporated into your play style so long as you don't overdo it like I said first and foremost you want to be making sure that you are supporting the teammates but if you just sit there with the heal beam literally the whole game and heal your teammates that is not as useful as you can be when everything is kind of clear in terms of healing and Reviving you can definitely still be very solid when it comes to getting kills and dealing damage so that is something you should try and focus on as well and kind of get the balance right there in terms of balancing that support role as well as the Slayer role too I ke to hear your thoughts though guys let me know of anything in this video that you disagree with or any tips of your own for those reading the comments I'm always Keen to hear your thoughts but with that being said thank you all very much for watching you guys have a great day and I'll see you all out there in the arena,"The user seems to indicate that the medium class is a popular and crucial class in 'The Finals', often used in team play and game-winning scenarios.

The user suggests that the CL-40 grenade launcher in 'The Finals' is not mentioned directly, but they do share their thoughts on the game's weapon balancing and loadout options. They emphasize the importance of having the heal beam specialization, noting its effectiveness in team play, especially when paired with a heavy class teammate. The heal beam is recommended even if other teammates are using it due to its ability to provide practically unlimited health.

For weapons, the user feels that the AKM is the best choice due to its reliability. They state that it's an ideal weapon for beginners and offers a good balance of power and accuracy. The FKART is also mentioned as a viable option, but they caution that it carries more risk due to its smaller magazine capacity of 20 rounds, which does not forgive missed shots and requires immediate reloading after killing an enemy. The user suggests that the AKM allows for better spray transfer, meaning you can quickly shift your aim from one enemy to the next. The user didn't mention the CL-40 grenade launcher in the text provided. The opinion focuses mainly on the balancing between the F card and the AKM. They believe that the AKM is slightly better than the F card due to its efficiency in killing a heavy.

However, they acknowledge that there are many good gadgets for the medium class and the choice depends on the player's strategy and preference.

The user suggests that if a player is not planning on using the defib, they should consider choosing a different class. They also see the medium class as the best one, also due to the heal beam ability.

The Finals Medium Class guide,81CpaQSUMG8,How to Win More with Medium Class â€“ The Finals Pro Tips,medium is the most used Class in the finals right now I think and after close to 650 hours in the game I want to share the things I've learned Ming medium and high level lobbies but before you jump in the arena make sure you know what you're up against one of the things I like to do is check the leaderboard before getting into the game this way I know which classes I'm up against and I can choose my counter weapons and gadgets if I see a lot of lights in my Lobby for example I'll choose between the F card the revolver or the model 1887 because I counter best lights with those weapons one of the most interesting things I found about this game is how Embark managed to make the medium a support class while also acting as an assault class you can do just as much damage if not more than a heavy or light while still supporting your team more than they can this brings me to the heal beam I've seen a lot less medium players use the heal beam after their season 4 Nerf but it's still an extremely powerful tool for the medium class I'm sure we've all been against a three medium heal beam circle jerk before I'm back circle jerk circle jerk circle jerk circle jerk circle jerk but remember you don't always have to be aggressive as medium you can hang back with the heal beam and watch the show I'm healing you bro I'm healing you bro I'm healing you bro it's all you bro nice another thing you can do with the heal beam is the body block heal Strat that I'm sure you've all encountered before which is also really good for the last second steals but hey if you're not a heal beam guy that's okay with me you have to find the best specializations and gadgets that fit your play style I personally like to stay alive as long as I can so I've been using a lot of things to keep me alive like the goo grenade and dematerializer as of recent Staying Alive while dealing damage to your opponents helps your team a lot because even if you can't finish someone off on your own your team is there to help you and if one of your teammates go down you can defib someone and keep them alive speaking of staying alive make sure you're using your movement and gadgets to outplay your opponents this is especially useful when fighting in buildings cuz the enemies never expect a window jump when I'm being chased utilize your gadgets use Goo or grenades or flashbangs whatever you need to help stay alive this kind of goes for every class but let's say you aren't running the right gadgets or you ran out well using the canisters around the map is extremely underrated I've gotten out of so many situations where I should have died but a trusty goo canister or red canister was there to save my life when I should have very easily died for all you AR users make sure you learn The Recoil pattern of your gun with that said I don't even fully know the recoil pattern of every gun I have the memory of a goldfish but I do remember the F car pattern because all the bullets do is go up to the right slightly this one was very easy to learn for me and with the season 4 update allowing me to remove the scope the F car has become a lot more satisfying to use so before jumping into a game check out the patterns in the practice range or do what I do and just shoot a wall when you join a game for a quick reminder of The Recoil pattern remember that Medium is a support class so if you're the type of player that likes defending cash outs then don't be sleeping on the mines sometimes you can get away with some pretty ridiculous things a man uh on that the will have to oh my God oh my oh my no [Â __Â ] way dude that's wild that is insane the glitch mine is still very powerful despite its season 4 Nerf you only get one but you can place two on the map once it's done charging up throwing a glitch mine on a statue is a great counter to other mediums and it's one of the most frustrating things they can encounter going for a defib on your teammate and being glitched and switched to your primary weapon is not a good time team coordination is huge in this game and I I get it solo cubing is tough but try to find someone you played well with and AD them having your team all push someone is easily one of the best ways to win and having coordination and trying out different things may surprise not just your team but you as well you're going to jump head up break through the window and place two turrets all right okay here hold on hold on wa wait so I'm going to place this jump Pad Place the turrets then we're going to go around over that side and you're going to jump P okay yeah yeah all right okay let's go turret jump drop all right now come back there I a jump pad right here moving follow go flank oh my God please oh my God oh my God what the [Â __Â ] dude so there you have it that's how you use medium get creative use your movement and support skills to your advantage keep your team alive and have some fun if you enjoyed the video consider leaving a like And subscribe for more finals content also leave a comment below if you found some tips and

The Finals Medium Class guide,PaSJNoNkh60,How to be the Medium Player that your teammates will love,so you want to play the medium class maybe it's because you saw how some of the top players play medium and decided that you want to take your gameplay to that level or maybe you've gotten addicted to the movement that the zip line and the jump pad provide you or maybe you just saw the AK-47 and decided yep yep this is this is the class it's been decided whatever the case may be you've come to the right place with this video I'll be giving you all the information that you need so that you can stop your gaml from looking like this here let me get this defib off real quick jump pad there's a guy turret out you're done for it buddy there's two what the what that there's two of them that's not that's not fair as a medium you are playing one of the most versatile classes in the game you're good on attack defense and support but with these advantages comes a large skill Gap that you need to be aware of when you pick this character so to help you climb that skill Gap I'm going to be providing a bunch of tips for every medium specialization throughout this video as well as tips for medium class as a whole and with all that being said let's get started so the very first thing that I'm going to do here is put down this jump pad for my team right here which allows me and in particular my heavy teammate to get very aggressive with the Enemy team I noticed that my Heavy's health bar is getting kind of low and at this time I take a ton of damage so I reposition and heal my heavy so he can take the fight instead I'm also going to do a quick defp on the heavy teammate which is just going to give us a lot more certainty in being able to close out this fight but something that I've noticed is that there there are a lot of people who use defibs at really bad times so I'm going to quickly explain when you should defib and when you should not this is when it's okay to defib if you can gain numbers advantage on the enemy team or at least equal out your team numbers to stall a cash out and divert attention in emergencies and to quickly reset if you expect a third party but there are many times when you should not defib some of these are if someone is already resing if you are unlikely to win the fight even with the defib an instance of this would be if you are in a 1v3 and everybody is at half or more Health if you have to die for the res in some cases this one is okay but 95% of the time dying to get a defib off is a really bad idea and if you are in no danger and you can save it for later treat your defib like a valuable commodity do not waste it so now that I've discussed when you should and shouldn't defib let's go back to the gameplay examples after we've secured this cashbox it's time to put our movement to use again taking height is very important in this game because if you don't have someone else will and medium's utility lets you get that height Advantage very fast I heard some enemy footsteps so I decided to Ping wildly to let my team no to group up if you are playing solo queue and something important like this is happening please use your ping Button as it can really be the difference between you winning that fight and you losing that [Applause] fight one contestant doesn't seem now some of you may have noticed that we are leaving this cash out before it's completed we are doing this because this cash out is honestly almost done and it's highly unlikely that a team steals during this time and before this I had checked the scoreboard and I had seen that all of the teams were actually doing damage which means that they are all fighting over the cash out more than likely however this is where I almost make a crucial mistake not playing with my team it's important to play buyer team when you are a medium or a heavy but especially as a heal beam when I realize my mistake I immediately go to regroup with my heavy who can hopefully protect me my heavy decided to dome shield in and go for the cash out but instead of healing him the whole time like a lot of mediums would I Instead try to kill the people shooting at him there's a time into place for healing but if you can outright kill an opponent it's better to do that instead of just healing King them and hoping that they survive after I deposited this cash out I noticed that D already has a fair bit of progress on it and it's close by that means there's the potential for us to be able to take both cash outs and if we could pull that off that would be a huge Advantage but before I push in I try to get some opening damage from long range and wait for my heavy to push in ahead of me when you're the healbe medum you want to try to be the Last One Alive as often as possible as he takes the cash out I'm going to watch to make sure that nobody tries to kill him while he takes it once again this medium shows up near the end of the Steal but because the cash out is nearly stolen I go to heal instead of kill after I whiff some really easy shots here I go to defib the heavy in case of a third party now here is a very important decision making moment when I go over to push up on this cash box I notice that the timer is nearly up and both of my teammates are busy fighting so if we want to take this box I have to act now luckily my teammates were able to body block for me and we were able to take it so while you as a heal beam medium probably shouldn't be the one taking the cash box in certain Niche scenarios like this you just might have to do it anyways also if this video has been helpful consider leaving it a like as it really does help me out a ton and if you like the sound of mostly weekly finals videos consider subscribing it's okay I can wait okay I'm done now let's get back to the video in this game I'm in a triple medium team and I'm playing with dematerializer with dmat you can afford to play a little bit more aggressively and a little bit more like a light player because you don't have to worry about healing your teammates so I'm going to be pretty front and center in a lot of these fights I see that the heavy has put up a barricade and is playing behind it so I decide to pressure him with the dmat my teammate manages to take down the heavy but then goes down but instead of getting the defibr I leave that to the other more support focused medium in my team and try to go and finish off the light once again I'm going to give my team a little bit of movement so we can deposit the cash box faster and then we're going to to take height it's actually a much better idea to not hold the cash boox on the moving platform but instead to follow it around from High Ground if you get this specific event instead of chasing this team across and trying to kill them we are going to take this zip line all the way to the top of Apartments where we will be able to hold a much better position and can use our movement gadgets to quickly rotate to the platform if necessary if this team doesn't want to get jump padded on top of they're going to have to challenge us while we have the positioning Advantage at this point I go into get aggressive with my dmat and get their attention and some opening damage but then I rotate out with my jump pad and let my teammates clean up after we finish this fight we're going to use the zipline to once again rotate over to the next building and be ready for another fight if necessary and sure enough pink team is going for the Cash Out station so I decide to drop down and keep them from stealing the cash out even if it means that I end up dying I managed to stop them from stealing with my aggressive play and while they are focused on dealing with me my teammates are able to get some pretty free damage on so this next engagement is a really good example of how you should play dmat around cash out a lot of dmat players would like to drop the cash out immediately upon depositing the cash box but this isn't a great idea here I'm going to hold the high ground with the rest of my team to try and stop the enemy before they even reach the cash out here by playing below the cash out instead of above it I can drop it down and stall for longer and possibly isolate A3 V1 if I also manage to get one of the opponents then me and my team are going to rotate to the floor below again to do the exact same thing here pink team finds us and takes a fight but because we aren't playing in the room with the cash boox we are limiting our chances of being attacked by a third party after I whiff some of my shots I go and defit my teammate instead of slow resing because I hear footsteps and I expect that I will need to drop the cash out immediately some other ways that you can use the dmat is by playing very aggressively with it and cutting off opponents who might be running away from you [Music] at the time of recording this video turret is easily the worst specialization you can use for medium unless you play terminal attack however if you still want to use it I do have a few tips for you on how you can maximize your turret efficiency be careful about some of the materials that you place your turrets on for instance these ceilings on Soul tend to break really e easily and if your turret falls down from them it's pretty much useless a lot of players expect you to place your turrets near the cash out but if you do this too much it can become predictable and your turrets lose a lot of their value FX it up once in a while by placing it in an area away from the cash out where you can either fall back to or play from to catch the Enemy by surprise another example of good turret placement is this clip right here where I placed it in a space that will cover either staircase from the enemy that they could push up from Once the turret does some opening damage I Engage The Enemy while they are distracted to get a quick kill I also tend to notice a lot of turret medium players like to sit by their turret at all times you don't need to do this and this actually limits you a lot don't be afraid to push enemies and then when they chase you go run back to where your turret is placed to make them really choose between whether they want to keep pushing you or if they want to back up and not deal with that turret something else that I do to mix things up as well is placing my turret in one area for the first fight at a cash out and then moving it after that fight is finished to be much closer to the cash out this usually really catches my opponents off guard and can be a great way to mix up your strategy but besides these tips just play turret medium in a similar way to the dematerialize your medium and you should be fine and those are a bunch of ways that you can be a better medium player now all of these things can be quite a lot to take in so if you feel overwhelmed by all this information just try focusing on one thing at a time until you've mastered that and then move on to the next thing I really hope that this video was helpful and entertaining and if it was consider giving it a like as it really does help out the channel and consider subscribing for mostly weekly videos on the finals and with that I'll see you in the next one [Music],"The text doesn't provide specific opinions about the CL-40 grenade launcher or

The Finals Medium Class guide,xFweVI3V5IU,How to MASTER Medium Support Guide | The Finals Pro Gameplay Coaching,I'm the gum buuck this is the finals and in this video I'm going to show you how to be a medium Master support I'm going to talk about the dos the don'ts the things I did right and the mistakes I made I'm on a team we've got a random heavy here I'm paired up with a light um you I'm rocking the akm defib jump pad and frag grenade of course I've got that heal beam so we're pushing up on the point oh snap okay we got something located I'm trying to lay down some fire I'm backing up I'm going to let the medium push up and just kind of sit back for a support pull my heel beam out let them kind of work I'm going for a flank here so I'm hoping that they can maintain while I come around trying to get some shots from a far stick the heel Beam on my light come on light Let's Stay Alive here all right going to reposition up to the roof taking that jump pad just for that maneuverability that's nice all right so I banged out in assist there dropping down putting down some suppression fire let's toss some frag nades in there again I'm letting uh letting that heavy be up front he's rocking the uh flamethrower so he's kind of a close range he's got a close range build and I'm going to push up to get him healed back up want to get this want to get my light back alive pull him out I'm going to stick him for the res there in a second but let's get this guy down so pushing up going back for the flank and uh the light revived but looks like the heavy managed to finish that guy off I believe so I'm going to grab this uh flame bang and try to inhibit them from following light wraps that ties someone was trying to come up behind us in light just wrapped him up so let's go all right now we've got the Vault we're pushing cash box a we're going to go plant this B uh heav is going up the stairs I don't know why he didn't take the zip would have been a little faster wouldn't it so I'm going to try to block off some paths there uh try to isolate the lanes that people can attack this cash box that way we have a better idea of where they may be coming from uh I'm going to grab a gas I think I wanted to gas the point here but then I changed my mind I was going to gas this guy all right so I throw that over there try to get some shots off on him he drops down and you know I'm just trying to keep a you know an eye on the uh health bars of my teammates there on the bottom left got a guy on cat on point pushing up for the support switch to the hill beam I'm going to just let this heavy do his thing all right that that went pretty good there so we've got this point here they uh magenta Pops in throwing some nades just trying to again you see my position it's all about the position I'm sitting back I'm letting heavy do the Frontline stuff heel beaming heel beaming push up with that flame throw he's got that close range attack he's pressuring I'm chasing we're going to wrap that up all right that's a team wipe right there orange is uh on The Fray the heavy did come down after me that was a good move on him we had some really good Synergy even playing with this Rando in terms of like pocketing pocketing is a term uh maybe I coined it but it's just really sticking to super hard sticking together beating each other's back pockets got orange pushing up heavy clears the gas with his flames and I'm just trying to make sure all my team is always full HP if I can get another assist there while that light does his thing they're trying to come up from the hole in the uh ceiling there so um the flame flamethrower heav pushing them back trying to keep them at Bay I'm just going to throw that Beam on him in case they try to put some suppression fire and they didn't seem like they did so uh oh oh light light goes up top to finish it up that's a great flank by our light and it seems like we are holding this down pretty pretty well ladies and gents all right so Heavy's Heavy's taking it he seems like he's in good condition he's going up the stairwell all right someone's dropping someone's above again I'm going to I know got some shots on him clean that kill up nice and dandy checking everything out making sure we got the lay to land there and we do we do nice so we dominated that cash boox and oh teammates getting into the fight here so I'm going to help them out manage to wax that dude let's let's go pushing up throwing the heel beams on again you see my positioning right so if you want to be a master medium support it's all about positioning you need to be in a place where you can deal damage but also give support to your team in way of the heals boom jump pad zip let's go movement Tech if you don't know if you're not doing that go ahead and hit that jump pad zip all right to get out of the hospital a little bit a little bit more quickly so again communicating I see that my light got hit cuz I'm watching those health bars the whole time in the bottom left I'm paying attention also to my teammates health bars that's game awareness they get hit I know that the that they're engaging and I can move to support so I'm going to go flank this guy easy wrap up there but I hit the land mine uh but you know the heavy smart smart guy clears that gas for me real quick even though I walked over the other mine but we're not going to talk about that and we're going to push up for this next Vault oh oh what was this guy doing he comes back we get that team shot elimination I'm going to quickly get my uh light back up to fighting weight make sure his HP is all the way back up just in Cas for another engagement and he manages to finish up this little straggler orange and that's I believe another team wipe oh wait no there he is he comes over he makes it I couldn't believe that we couldn't double tap that zip to remove it so he would have fallen to his demise but nonetheless we're pushing up in here our heavy is getting hurt so we're going to try to pay attention to that we're all going to reposition Oh I thought he was right there that's my mistake but we're gonna go up quickly to try to support him and get pocket back up again so he's doing his thing with the close range flame and I want to throw that heel Beam on him so he can just mash it was a 1 V one there so in that situation I definitely want to heal beam him sometimes you got to make a call whether it's uh 2v two or Pardon Me 1 V2 meaning heavy or 1v3 so heavy versus three and whether you uh applick damage or you apply heals so again we got that easy steel I was positioned to lay down some frag nades but also hit the heel Beam on the heavy to support his steel if he need needed it and uh so we get that steel before the cash out is even at the quarter of the time Mark and I think we just hit that so now it's just hold it's just aiming bang baby so again look at my positioning we got the tripod here this is uh Phil Jackson's the Chicago Bulls it's the triangle defense all right so I'm going to push up get some heal beams come on heavy come on get my range there we go there we go let him do his thing let him do his thing he does oh okay oh this is awkward he gets that res off this guy oh this guy's getting away no sir not today not today friend I go up to finish that kill cuz I'm a shark and I smell blood and water now we're going to reposition here to focus back on the cash out make sure that it's protected and it looks pretty safe so but look at this positioning ladies and gentlemen this whole video is all about the position I'm right behind my team I'm able to support all right putting some shots down switch to heel beam throw some nades helps with suppression heal beam heal beam heal beam there you go there you go look at that all right he's racing he's got full health so I I was going to switch to my weapon to help lay that suppression fire to catch him if my heavy couldn't with his Flames cuz he's got limited range whereas I got I don't have as much limited range now we only have a quarter less than a quarter left throwing some nades make sure you guys are using your utilities guys don't sleep on utilities constantly be spamming them spam your utilities use them at the right time right position pull the gun out to lay suppression cuz my heavy got good HP trying to build his HP back up as we push and look look at that we've got this W that's a zero death W five kills 12 assists zero deaths if you love the finals like I do stay tuned because there will be more content coming

The Finals best weapons season 4,2yeLtejNKr0,The BEST and WORST Weapons in The Finals Season 4,here are the best and the worst weapons in the finals season 4 while I was I dropped my mouse where did it go while I Was preparing for the challenge stream that I had with fixie and dank D I figured that it was time to post a new tier list as well and of course as usual huge thanks to Embark for sponsoring this video if you guys want to check out season 4 links in the description let's dive into it starting off with light and the F tier we of course have to talk about the bow now I don't like the bow I know it was buff this season but I have a bone to pick with this thing I think it's just too inconsistent seeing it is a projectile weapon you still need to draw it and it's just not reliable enough when you compare to other weapons in this tier therefore again we're going to put the recurve bow and the F tier but I can definitely see people doing better with it and getting some value out of it if they want to play really flashy heading on into the E tier we going to start it off with the 93 R I know it was buffed this season and honestly yeah you can really feel it it definitely feels better than season 3 or even season 2 but it does still not really pack that much of a punch it is a burst weapon so maybe if you play around corners you can see some value but overall I feel like it just does not help me as a light I want to be able to go in and deal a lot of damage and get a kill and then get out rather than you know slowly plinking enemies down because if I keep plinking enemies down he's going to kill me eventually without me actually killing them so overall even though it was buffed it's easier to use now the sights feel a little bit better and of course the spread is better it just doesn't really hit home just yet which is why again I keep it into etier I never weapon into etier will remain there for the same reason maybe I am rating it too low but I kind of feel like it belongs here and that's the new weapon for a light and it's probably the only new weapon this season that I rate lowly and and of course it's going to be the M26 matter which is a decent gun in theory it can definitely put out a lot of damage however it's more of a sustained damage type of Deal or again you know darting in and out of corners but if you try to all in an enemy and try to get a kill on an enemy let alone a heavy or a medium you're going to die 99% of the time if you have M26 matter whereas if you use any more reliable weapons you probably would get the kill and the thing is that your lack of playing both in the open and one oneing both of the l3r on M26 matter so weapons that take a long time to kill somebody with is obviously bad for light but it's exacerbated by the fact that weapons like SE 40 is really dominating The Meta right now and the SE 40 will out DPS you if you get too close if you TR playing Corners the se40 will just kill you around the corner so you cannot win no matter what you do these guns are just not good enough and it's made even worse by The Meta so again in E tier you have both the 93r M26 matter as for the D tier we're going to started off with the dagger this might be a controversial opinion I know some people say that it's nerfed I guess they might be right it might be a bit slower hitting the alternate fire the back step with the dagger now but you can control it personally after a small adjustment period other than the speed I felt like I got more kills with a dagger now it was just so much easier going for trick stabs just jumping all over the place I just had more control of what I was doing and I believe that most users that weren't Die Hard dagger users probably see this as an overall buff because it is so much easier to actually perform with it it's more consistent sure you can't run and backstab that an entire enemy team in the back in a short span of time which you kind of already couldn't unless you got really lucky so yeah I still think it's pretty solid it just suffers from the same reason that light is suffering the same season and I just cannot rate it any higher than D I'd rather have a weapon in my hand another weapon in the D tier is going to be sh1 1900 which is solid it can one shot a light but again it's not really reliable enough in my opinion maybe it's a skill issue I don't like it you can two shot a medium and get that burst damage if you really try but it's just too much effort without enough of a reward and it's just not consistent enough in my opinion probably because of the screen shake that I want to rate anywhere higher than D so again in the D tier we're going to put the dagger and the sh1 1900 moving on into the C tier we're going to start that tier off with the sword now the sword actually saw some changes and it doesn't look like a lot on paper but once you play with it you can really feel like it feels a lot different the weapon is a lot more accurate now but obviously if you get used to the old accuracy it will take some time adjusting to I didn't manage to do that in time the lunge on your secondary ability has been raised from 5 me to 6 M or so but it feels like an entire Dash you just go flying in One Direction especially seeing as the lunge attack now maintains the top speed for slightly longer so it just feels like you're really flying or dashing forward when you're lunging it feels really good to use the sword and honestly maybe C tier is rating it too low but once you compare to the other weapons higher up in the list it will make sense another weapon in the C tier is going to be the throwing knives which now also saw a buff that you can just hold the right click and let go whenever you want it doesn't make that much of a difference for the throwing knives in my opinion maybe it's because when I was playing the throg knives I just made a habit of spamming right click and then eventually I would hit the enemy when it came around the corner or whatever I didn't really feel like it was a necessary addition it's a quality of lifing it's appreciated but it's still the throwing knives I feel like like you just don't really get to do much with them they deal a decent amount of damage but they're a projectile weapon and seeing as you're trading with heavy or medium again the whole Cal 40 problem or even the pike you're just going to die every single time if you're using the Frog knives they're just not amazing they're middle of the pack C tier is not amazing and closing out to C tier I'm going to put the v9s here I know it's a solid gun I would love to put it higher but I don't think that it has enough damage where it's worth it I know that jel can put a sight on the v9s and it feels really good especially with certain skins as you now can actually see what you're shooting at much more easily it's easier to track the enemy but compared to the other weapons which we'll get to in a little bit it has a semi-auto trigger so you need to keep spam clicking it the hip fire is not very reliable on it and the Damage isn't all that I don't have the updated numbers in front of me but I'm pretty sure it probably deals the same as like an M11 or a pre-nerf xp54 it's not insane it just doesn't make that much of a difference so again in the C tier we're going to place the sword the Frog knives and the be B NS all decent choices just a little bit on the troll side you probably better off using the following weapons instead so starting off the bti we have the lh1 now the lh1 is in a particular place I'm going to keep it in the B tier because it is a solid weapon especially now that you can put a sight on it but it still has gotten a indirect Nerf because of where the meta is heading again seal 40 or whatever or if you get to the longer ranges you're going to be playing as Pike users which we're going to cover in a little bit and you're just going to lose every time because the break point on a pike I believe a medium can kill a light with free shots but it takes I think four or five for a light to kill the medium back with the lh1 and it's just such a big difference in the time to kill that it's just not worth it using the lh1 if you're facing something like a pike which you probably will face all the time again it's definitely a buff maybe can use it as a single fire xp54 variant this season but overall it it works just not my biggest recommendation for light another weapon in the B is going to be the sr84 now this actually saw a Nerf because you now fire projectile shots past 4 met rather than just hit scan all the way but it's still a pretty good gun especially in a longer range meta I could argue that you have a better chance beating a medium with a pike by using a sr84 then you are with an lh1 because you can shoot once s 84 and if it's a heady they're going to have what 10 Health left you can just shoot them in a body or maybe they already were low enough in which case they're just going to die but lh1 exposes you for too long to actually give you proper value if you're trading with a long range fighter but that was that for the B tier again that's the lh1 and the sr84 going into the B tier hopping on into the a tier we have the xp54 which was my previous s tier pick it is a great gun I still think it's a great gun despite seeing a noticeable Nerf to its damage per second it lost two damage per bullet but seeing as it is a high fire rate weapon that makes a very huge dent in its damage per second over the course of a whole clip and you can really feel it when you're trying to fight for example a heavy or in some cases even a medium with good movement and it just doesn't feel the same it's still a solid gun I still felt like I was getting kills with it it's has very reliable and in my opinion pretty easy to control recoil pattern but it doesn't hit as hard so again that puts the XP 4 in the a tier and that brings us to the S tier for a light this season it stands out over the all even xp54 and that is the M11 which technically didn't even get a buff this season unless you count the reticle above which I guess it is so the M11 is the exact same has always been it's been pulling the valves strategy of doing absolutely nothing and having the cover guns just fall over face first and be useless it deals a solid amount of damage as we always have known it has a very good hip fire when it comes to spraying across most Rangers I think up to 5 or 10 m it's very accurate with the addition of the non-world Crosshair setting which makes your Crosshair in the middle of the screen static so it's easier to track an enemy when a lot of things are going around where the voice would jump around in addition to receiving a reticle which lets you aim down sight and actually see what you're shooting at just makes the M11 so good and seeing as xp54 which I believe had a higher DPS than M11 previously doesn't anymore there's really no reason to run anything else in M11 right now so if I would put any weapon in s for light I don't think light is in that of a healthy place at the moment but if I had to put one weapon in the s for light it's a pretty solid weapon and that's going to be the M11 moving on let's talk about medium who is seeing a massive stride to season so starting off going to start off with the F tier of all their weapons and it's really only one weapon here that I have to quickly mention and that is still going to be the dual blades I do not like them I've never liked them and probably never will they're like a riot shield but worse the deflect or the reflect is not reliable you still bleed health over time even if you're constantly holding it up and you're just going to die a lot as a medium using the dual blades it's like a riot shield which was my previous Le favorite weapon but way worse that was it for f tier so let's skip the E tier and we're going to talk about the D tier and of course that's going to be the riot shield again I don't like melee weapons in general I definitely don't like them on medium especially when they deal kind of consistent damage the thing is with the riot shield and even dual blades is that they do offer some protection indicates through the right Shield you have a big Square in front of you that bullets just will not go through whether you hold your Shield up or not it would just possibly do that there are some types of outplays that you can do with a right Shield when you combine it with different gadgets to get more value out of it and it was buffed this season but overall when you compare to actual weapons it's just going to fall short which is why the r Shield stays in a d tier hopping on over into the C tier we have the which received a buff this season you can out put a sight on it however at least in my opinion it is still not hitting as hard as it could or should and now that we have the pike which we will cover soon the Famas kind of doesn't have a place anymore it used to be a maybe mid to long range poking weapon and seeing as we were getting sights added to it a lot of people myself included thought it was poised to be the poking weapon for medium but it's just being power crap there's no reason to run the Famas at the moment which is why I put it in the C tier but popping on into the B tier we have two weapons the first one is a model 1887 I want to place this higher because it is an insanely good weapon in theur and on paper and in a lot of situations but when you're are fighting across the mid to Long ranges it's obviously going to be pretty useless you can pop off if you close a gap and you fight on a point absolutely but if you're fighting teams that is holding a position sitting up on high grounds and you shooting at you with seal 40s or shooting at you with Pikes there's not really much you can do with a model in hand you could make an argument it might belong in the eigh tier but I'm going to keep it in the B tier for now another weapon in the B tier is going to be the cl40 which was buff this season you can definitely feel it it's annoying as hell to fight against especially if you're playing light and in some cases medium because it's very little effort and it will let you get a lot of kills however it still only comes with four shots per magazine it still will be outdps by a lot of weapons in the game and if you have a high ground on a heal for the user they will deal no damage to you it's frustrating to play against it is much easier to use yourself and get maybe a Cheesy killer so so but it's just not reliable enough where I can place it any higher than the B tier so again that put some model and a c 40 in the B tier but moving on we have the a tier and that's going to start off with the akm now as of this season a tiny Nerf it now has 32 bullets instead of 35 you can feel it in some cases I will run into people that run out of ammo when they were one shot away from killing me so if you really use the magazines all the way through consistently it's going to be worse for you to season but you can now attach a sight to it which makes a massive difference and honestly I am more accurate with a sight and I can spare these free bullets as the trade-off is me hitting more than free bullets thanks to having an actual sight you know helping me to actually line up the shots correctly it is a consistent damage weapon pretty easy to control recoil and it just hits really hard another weapon in the a tier is going to be the F car I kind of wanted to move the F car maybe down to the B tier maybe akm would be upper a tier F car would be lower or maybe it's just kind of whichever you prefer because while the akm on paper should be better the F car still feels really good to use it almost feels better than the akm to use I don't know have to wear any undocumented changes or maybe I'm just so used to F card it feels better for me but I actually really like the F card season it hits hard it's consistent it comes with a site so it's up to you what you want to do and of course closing out the we have a weapon that I very much enjoy myself that is the revolver and this one probably benefits the most from a site out of all the weapons in this whole tier list out of in all classes really aiming with the iron sight with revolver used to be really awkward and was probably one of the main reasons that was holding it back from being as good as it could be but thanks to adding a sight to it this season you can now actually again you can see what you're shooting at it's much easier to Blink head shot and just pop off with it it hasn't seen any other Nerfs but this site alone just makes it a lot more relevant than a lot of other weapons it's also a decent weapon if you want to trade back against the medium to maybe even long range depending on how far that long range is so again in the a tier we're going to put the akm the F car and the revolver but then as for the S tier maybe the s+ tier overall if I would compare all the weapons in this game so far this one would take the cake by a long shot but very much intend that some people have disagreed with me on this but I'm going to stand by it and that's that the pike currently is the best gun in the finals and obviously for medium as well the pike hits incredibly hard across really long ranges the damage fall off doesn't seem to exist the scope is a bit awkward to use but it still hits really hard again it three shots are light in the body it's what two shots a medium double head shot and I believe double head shots one body shots are heavy so it shreds across all ranges it's very easy to use the magazine size is fine the only downside with the pike is that sure it has kind of a crappy hip fire and over closer ranges You could argue that it's awkward to use the scope if somebody's really close but all in all if you're accurate with your weapons the Pike's going to be insane it's so good it's maybe not as forgiving as a full auto weapon but again if you're just accurate I cannot see any better weapon this season and it's going to be a must have for me so again the pike goes into the S tier and finally let's talk about heavy starting off with the F tier we're going to have the mgl 32 which was buff this season it's not not enough still terrible Embark is promising a rework to the mgl in the near future or in the future and we're just going to have to wait and see what that entails if I could suggest something as some people who watch My Stream over at twitch.tv/ did ask you know what I would like to see to make it good and honestly if the mgl just exploded on impact with an enemy so it would still need to bounce two times to explode against props or whatever but again against an enemy or a shield instantly explode that would make a massive difference to how good the mgl 32 is because right now it's too consistent and unreliable and I haven't used it I don't know how much different it would be I don't know how the damage would feel but I think on its own that would make a massive difference in just how viable mgl 32 is but anyways that was it for the F tier we put the mg32 moving on into the E tier we have first off the spear which maybe we could have put farther down but it did receive a buff this season I am not a spear enjoyer i' say time and time again I'm not a melee enjoyer but the Run speed modifier during the secondary Spin Attack is now faster so you move a little bit faster as you doing the spin attack can still be decent if you catch enemies off guard or something but at the same time the mesh Shield was nerfed this season it's practically useless especially if you use it with certain types of weapons like melees where you kind of want to weave the shield in and out which to me means that the spear is in a really bad place this time maybe I would put it in the F tier but I feel like I still do better with a spear than I do with the mgl so we're just going to keep it there another weapon in the E tier is going to be the ks trree maybe I'm rating this too low sue me I don't think it's really that good it has some utility with you know it can destroy walls and whatnot but it doesn't really have that much damage it's not really that consistent as it fires a projectile and the Damage even if you do hit every shot doesn't really feel like it's all that maybe if you're just throwing suggestions out today I would love to see if the ks23 could head shot just as a maybe I would love to see what it feels like keep it difficult to use projectile weapon but reward that accuracy with head shots and depending on how impactful that would be it would probably feel like a c or B2 weapon just from that change alone putting it out there just saying so again that puts the spear and K free in the E tier hopping on into the D tier we have the flamethrower which also saw an indirect Nerf dis season because the Chang to mesh Shield which was a very important piece of the flamethrower kit even more so than the spear because weaving The Shield up and down and just kind of dowsing the enemies with a little bit of flames at a time was a valid Strat probably the main Strat for the flamethrower and again it doesn't work so that whole Strat is dead that being said I tried using the gravity Cube that was buff this season with the flamethrower and it felt really good thanks to the much larger range so there is some viability there you can still make it work with some other strats and it deals a decent amount of damage if you use it right definitely better than the spe the K three in my opinion which is why I put it in the D tier heading on into the C tier however we have the Sledge that's a great weapon I love the sledge so much best melee weapon in my opinion you could argue the sword is about the same but the Sledge provides more utility it can one shot you have these one shot Combos and it just has a higher impact especially as you're playing heavy which gives you more utility than I like either way that's just about heavy versus light more than anything but the Sledge just deals a lot of damage and is very reliable assuming you can close the gap so usually would want to run it with a winch claw again M Shield was nerfed less reliable but you can still make it work with the winch or even charge and slam if you feel like it though probably the winch makes more sense another weapon in the C tier that struggled a lot from the mes Shield Nerf and I keep I'm going to keep mentioning the mes Shield because I think that is the most impactful Nerf for heavy season it's going to be the sa26 you can still use the sa1 1216 with say a winch and get some value out of it especially because the animation canel still works but seeing as you no longer have a shield that you can put up and stay behind if you accidentally overextend or you bite off more than you can chew the S6 kind of ends up being an All or Nothing sort of weapon if you take a fight that you shouldn't have there's no getting out of it you're just going to die and be an easy target dead Shield really made a difference in that you can still use the shield and try to escape with it but then you're going to catch you it's not really that good but again closing out the C tier we have Sledge and SFL 16 hopping on into the B tier we have two weapons that honestly feel really good maybe I should even put them higher than this but we'll put them in the BT for now for the first of those two is going to be the luig gun which saw a change to its recoil pattern and it really feels really good now I was surprised to just how much of a difference the Lou gun had it still has that okay first few shots it you know it doesn't have much of a recoil and then it starts picking up much like a assault rifle but as of season 4 the whole recoil has been minimized I guess it still follows the same pattern but much less so and it just feels really good to shoot it I think if I can get used to shooting this thing I'm going to start beaming people across all ranges it deals ton of damage when used right so it's definitely worth considering the other weapon in the B tier is going to be the M60 which not only can be attached with a sight as of this patch but the fire rate has also been marginally increased so it ches a little bit faster deals a little bit more damage I feel like the M60 recoil pattern which also has changed it mostly works the same where you have a hard recoil at the first few shots and then it's very smooth even smoother now as you continue firing so you can just go full Rambo it basically comes down to whichever play style you prefer use with these two different lmgs having the site is a nice addition but personally I don't feel like it makes that much of a difference cuz I got used to the M60 sites I guess it block a large part of your screen but it weren't that much of a problem or as much of a problem as people made them out to be in my opinion if anything I feel weird using a side rather than the actual iron sights but that is the B tier again that's where we put the L gun and M60 and then moving on in the E tier we have a weapon that I'm having a hard time finding the perfect place for but I think going to settle it right here and that is addition to heavy to season the double deagles the double deagles can shred if you hit consistent head shot or use consistent shots with them they are nearly Unstoppable again with the inor Crosshair being turned off so it's F static that helps with aiming them a lot they do lose their accuracy over longer ranges there's some spread no matter whether you're aiming down sights or not and in my opinion over longer ranges they're just not consistent enough even though they deal a lot of damage when they do hit however if you take it to mid-range or close range the deagles hit insanely hard especially if you combine them with other utilities or other gadgets and if you're heavy fighting against another heavy most of the times the deagles should win because they Havey let's say they're using a l Gunner M60 they're going to be standing still and spraying at you and you can just easily plink them in the head and kill them nearly instantly again the only reason I can't put the deagles in the S tier is that they aren't accurate enough and I feel like it comes down to a lot of RNG or Randomness whether you hit your shots over the longer ranges and I'm not a fan of RNG G because whenever I trust RNG it lets me down and I will never advocate for that for a weapon being good if it has a lot of RNG maybe it's just a spray pattern and I suck what do I know but either way that was it for heavy with the deagle in the E tier a huge thank you guys for watching this video if you have any disagreements which I'm sure some people will have let me know in the comments and uh yeah I'll see you all next time peace out,"The text does not provide any specific opinions or details about the CL-40 grenade launcher in the game 'The Finals'. The comments are centered around other weapons like the bow and the 93 R, but no mention is made of the CL-40. The text you provided doesn't include any specific opinions on the CL-40 grenade launcher or the medium class for the game 'The Finals'. There are detailed opinions about other weapons such as the M26 matter and the SE 40, and a possible nerf to the dagger, but no information about the CL-40 grenade launcher. Please provide additional information, if available. The review seems to place the CL-40 grenade launcher in the D tier, indicating that the reviewer doesn't find it reliable or consistent enough. The reviewer points out that while the weapon can cause substantial damage, it requires considerable effort and doesn't provide enough reward. The reviewer also mentions an issue with screen shake, which might be affecting the weapon's performance and player experience. It's also compared unfavorably to other weapons such as the sword and throwing knives which are ranked in the C tier, suggesting they are more favorable and have seen improvements. It's worth noting the reviewer's opinion may be influenced by their personal play style or skill with specific weapon types. However, overall, they seem to find the CL-40 grenade launcher underwhelming in its current state. The commentator perceives the CL-40 grenade launcher (also referred to as the Cal 40) as problematic and it seems to be a powerful weapon in the game, potentially affecting the balance of the game. They mention that players using other weapons, such as the throwing knives or other medium and light weapons, often find themselves at a disadvantage when facing opponents equipped with the CL-40, implying that the CL-40 may be too strong compared to other weapons in its class. Nonetheless, the commentator does not elaborate on specific attributes of the CL-40, such as its damage output, rate of fire, or usability.

Furthermore, the commentator also mentions the state of the meta in the game, suggesting that it is shifting in a direction that indirectly nerfs certain weapons while favoring others, like the CL-40 and the Pike. The Pike seems to be effective at long ranges, and its power is compared to that of the CL-40. As a result, the commentator suggests that players would be better off using these weapons instead of others.

Overall, the commentary suggests a possible imbalance in the game's weapon dynamics, particularly with the CL-40 grenade launcher. To maintain a competitive and fair environment, the developers might need to consider adjusting the CL-40's capabilities or enhancing other weapons to level the playing field. The text doesn't provide any specific details or opinions about the CL-40 grenade launcher for the game 'The Finals'. The text discusses other weapons such as the lh1, pike, sr84, xp54, and M11, but there's no mention of the CL-40. The player has mixed feelings about weapon balancing in the game. They seem to appreciate the M11 for its solid damage, exceptional hip fire accuracy, and new features such as the non-world Crosshair setting and reticle addition, making it easier to track enemies and aim respectively. The player suggests that the M11 is currently the top choice in the light weapon category.

However, the player was notably disappointed with the medium class weapons, particularly the dual blades and riot shield. They criticized the dual blades for their unreliability, constant health depletion, and overall lesser efficiency compared to the riot shield. The riot shield itself was also disliked due to its melee nature and the player's belief that it doesn't suit the medium class.

Unfortunately, no direct opinion was given on the CL-40 grenade launcher, as the provided text didn't mention it. Further information is needed to provide a detailed opinion about this weapon. The player has mixed feelings about the balancing of the weapons in the game 'The Finals'. They believe that the riot shield, despite offering some protection, falls short when compared to other weapons, especially after the recent buffs in the season. They also mentioned the Famas, which they believe has been overshadowed by the Pike weapon and no longer has a place in the game. 

The Model 1887 has potential, being a good weapon in theory and in certain situations, but falls short in mid to long range fights. The player suggests that it could potentially belong in a higher tier but decides to keep it in the B tier due to its limitations.

As for the CL-40 grenade launcher, it received a buff this season, making it noticeably stronger and more challenging to fight against. The player finds it annoying to fight against due to the buff. However, they do not provide a clear-cut opinion on whether they believe the weapon is balanced or not, or if its increase in power is a positive or negative change. They only provided their experience with the weapon after the buff. The CL-40 grenade launcher in the game 'The Finals' is considered a medium-tier weapon due to its balance of strengths and weaknesses. It's seen as a potent weapon, especially against light and medium classes due to its ability to secure a significant number of kills with minimal effort. However, users note that it only comes with four shots per magazine, limiting its potential. The weapon can also be outperformed by many other weapons in terms of damage per second.

Another downside is that it doesn't deal any damage if the user is on a higher ground, making it less effective in certain situations. Players find it frustrating to play against due to its power, but it's also considered easy to use and sometimes can result in easy kills. Yet, the reliability of the CL-40 is questioned, preventing it from being ranked higher than the B tier.

In comparison, the AKM and F Car weapons are considered A-tier due to their high damage and accuracy, particularly with the addition of sights. The AKM has received a slight nerf with reduced ammo but the accuracy improvement from the sight makes it still a reliable choice. The F Car is also praised for its consistency and power, despite some players suggesting it should be moved to B-tier. It's noted that choosing between the AKM and F Car is largely down to personal preference. The text provided mainly discusses the Revolver and the Pike weapon but doesn't provide any opinions or data on the CL-40 grenade launcher. The Revolver, with the addition of the sight, is now considered more relevant and effective in trading back against medium to long-range targets, making it a tier A weapon. The Pike, on the other hand, is regarded as the best gun in The Finals, especially for the medium class. It is highly praised for its power, range, and minimal damage falloff. However, it's noted that it has a poor hip fire and can be awkward to use in close ranges. Despite these, its high accuracy makes it an excellent weapon. For more detailed opinions about the CL-40 grenade launcher, you may need to provide a text that specifically discusses this weapon. The user's opinion about the CL-40 Grenade Launcher in the game 'The Finals' is not explicitly stated in the provided text. The user discusses the MGL 32 and other weapons like the Spear and KS TRREE, but does not mention the CL-40 Grenade Launcher. A detailed opinion or review on this particular weapon cannot be extracted from the given information. The user expresses dissatisfaction with the CL-40 grenade launcher's damage capacity, labeling it as inconsistent. Despite its ability to destroy walls, the damage inflicted even when hitting every shot doesn't feel impactful. The user suggests a balancing improvement, proposing that the game developers allow the launcher to headshot, making it a challenging yet rewarding weapon. This modification could potentially elevate the weapon's status from a C or B2 tier.

The user also mentions other weapons such as the ks23, the spear and K free which are placed in the E tier due to their perceived ineffectiveness. The flamethrower is also discussed, which the user feels has been indirectly nerfed this season due to changes to the mesh shield. Despite this, the user finds that the flamethrower can still work well with other strategies and deals decent damage, placing it in the D tier.

Lastly, the user praises the Sledge, describing it as the best melee weapon due to its high damage output and utility. It can execute one-shot combos and has a significant impact, especially when playing as a heavy character. This leads the user to place the Sledge in the C tier. The CL-40 grenade launcher in 'The Finals' game appears to be a reliable weapon of choice for players who can close the gap, and it's often advised to pair it with a winch claw. The M Shield, although nerfed, can still be used effectively with this weapon or other strategies such as the charge and slam. However, the winch is commonly viewed as a more logical pairing. 

The CL-40 has been impacted by the nerf of the M Shield, similar to other C tier weapons. This nerf has made the game more challenging, especially for those using weapons like the sa26 or the sa1 1216, which could previously rely on the shield for protection in case of overextension. 

The shield nerf has turned the game into an 'all or nothing' scenario where overextending in a fight without a backup plan leads to certain death, making the player an easy target. The shield can still be used as a means of escape, but it's generally viewed as not as effective as before.

Other weapons mentioned in the B tier, like the luig gun, have seen improvements in their recoil pattern, making them feel good to use. The luig gun, in particular, has surprised players with its significant change and the minimized recoil pattern in season 4, making it a worthy contender for dealing high damage across ranges. The provided information does not include any specific data or opinions on the CL-40 grenade launcher for the game 'The Finals'.

The provided text does not contain any information or opinions about the CL-40 grenade launcher for the game 'The Finals'. It mostly talks about the Deagle weapon and its accuracy.

The Finals best weapons season 4,F5ftJrD5RME,I tried and ranked EVERY weapon in The Finals SEASON 4 (Tier List),so we are now a few weeks into season 4 we've got some new weapons and balance changes to shake up the minute a bit and I wanted to let you all know what the best and worst weapons to use this season R I thought about making this list earlier but decided that I wanted to do this video later so that I could see if things were actually good or not instead of giving a possibly incorrect first impression and to give Embark some time to Nerf or buff some weapons as always I have everything timestamped if you want to find a specific weapon and just a reminder that if I put something low on this tier list it doesn't mean that you can't do well with or enjoy that weapon let me know if you agreee or disagree with any of my rankings down below and with that let's get started the M60 did get a pretty nice buff this season with both the increased fire rate and the addition of an equipable Red Dot site and it is a solid pick for any heavy the part where it has issues though is at range where the Dual 50s the Pike and the Lewis gun all beat it out all of which are very good this season in terms of ttk it is very slightly below the Lewis gun so it's technically the worst option but it's not a bad pick i' place it in the a tier the throw is a pretty accessible weapon that has the potential to be a good utility weapon and also a good crowd control weapon however it does have some notable drawbacks like having really low DPS and not having great range it's a niche gun that can be used to good AFF Landing it in the C tier the mgl needs some sort of a rework or a buff and while you can do good with it there's usually better options available and it's very inconsistent APS height jump pads and pretty much any close-range weapon are counters to it however it does have the ability to do some really nice structural damage and it's a pretty fun weapon to use I'll put it at the bottom of the C tier the Lewis gun is still fantastic and with the new recoil changes that were made to it this season it should be even more accessible this is in my opinion still one of the Heavy's best weapons it's super consistent has pretty good range and they made The Recoil more manageable which was previously its main drawback the range is still really good and it's still a very good pick even though everyone is busy using the Dual 50s it goes into the S tier the ks23 is an interesting gun I used it a lot while I was playing ranked ta last season and if you have very precise aim and can manage the bullet travel time and drop off this gun can be really good the ability to destroy the arena is an added bonus I personally find that using it with winch claw makes it really powerful I placed it at the bottom of the a tier the sa 12 is still one of the top guns in the game in general the time to kill versus lights and mediums is ridiculous and while using it with the mes Shield isn't quite as strong as it used to be this gun itself is still a beast I'd place it near the top of a tier the sledgehammer kind of dominated casual lobbies last season with the introduction of the winch claw but since then it hasn't quite been as popular while the damage is still great on it and the destructive capabilities are still quite good it does struggle against movement abilities and gadgets and with the current meta being more ranged focused this season it's going to go into the B tier the spear is in a bit of an awkward spot it has a little bit more range than the Sledge but that's about all that it has going for it the sludge has more utility and the old fire attack on the spear is practically useless due to how inconsistent the hit registration is it's a usable weapon you can do well with but Sledge is pretty much always a better pick Landing the spear in C tier the akimbo pistols added this season are some of the most stylish and the best weapons in the game at the moment the range is really good The Recoil is very manageable and it has great damage as well you do need half decent aim to use it at its full potential but that won't stop me from putting it in the S tier in general with the Nerf to the akm mag size and the rise of the model and the pike akm is no longer one of the top weapons in in the game but it is still very solid it has pretty good damage per mag and is good at bursting down heavy Shields and that larger mag size also makes it a good gun to run with the heal beam i' place it in the a tier for this season the Famas has been fairing a bit better as of late it has one of the best ctks versus Heavies out of the medium ARs and is a pretty decent gun the hit fire is also really good on the gun the new scope that was also added helps out those who like a longer range play style with the gun as well but it is going to be beat out by the pike so be aware of that I'm going to place it in the a tier right next to the akm the F car is also a fine pick this season well it's not as potent as it was back in season 1 it's silly pretty decent weapon and it actually has the fastest time to kill versus lights out of the medium ARS just like the others I'm going to place the F car in a tier so as you can see from this list we are more or less in a balanced state in my opinion with the medium ARs and you can really pick whatever suits your play style or the situation more the cl40 got buffed in the beginning of the season and a lot of people felt that this gun was too oppressive because because of this the Cal 40 did get a Nerf in the latest update Bringing Down the total damage the splash damage and increasing the self damage but they did increase the max size by one so now APS height and simply getting up in a cl40 user's face are all counters to this gun picking it not really that much of a threat if you know how to deal with it while fighting grenade launchers might be annoying for some it's really not that strong and goes into the C tier after the latest changes the revolver has always been a stylish Niche pick that has had some really good headshot and dueling potential it got a sight added this season which I originally thought was going to make the gun very good but unfortunately the pike exists and has pretty much beat it out in every single category Ember we really need to talk about the range on this thing it's horrible despite this it's still a solid enough weapon and if we were basing things off of style it'd go in the S tier but in practicality and because the pike exists I have to put it into the B tier the model hasn't received any Buffs ever so why is it so powerful this season it's mainly due to the other medium ARS being nerfed which really were its only competition in the medium weapon slot it's easily the best close- range option in the medium's loadout making it an S tier pick pair this with dematerializer and you have a very scary combination the dual blades are a bit of an unfortunate weapon medium already isn't a good melee class and it doesn't help that the dual blades deflect is super inconsistent you're better off just larning the riot shield for now if you want to play medium melee Landing this weapon into the D tier right Shield is another goofy weapon that I find to be a lot of fun but it doesn't do as well in higher level lobbies for the most part flamethrower is pretty much a hard counter to it and coordinated teams will exploit you only having a melee weapon on medium very easily but it's a great weapon to have a laugh with and it can be really good against uncoordinated teams I'd place it in the C tier the pike released this season super strong but it did get nerfed a little bit in the recent update it is still very good but now it sits below some of the assault rifles and ttk on mediums and Heavies however the strength of this gun is still the melts light players and the crazy amount of range that it provides this gun did get some much needed balancing because it was stronger than any of the other medium guns but it still remains in the S tier another of my favorite weapons the bow did get a buff this season making it a little bit more powerful but against good players it's still going to struggle a little bit it's not a bad Weapon by any means but I'm going to place it at the top of c-tier because it can perform well in the hands of a skilled player it's just that for the most part there are better options the 93r got a hip fire buff this season but it is still one of the worst light weapons the time to kill is really not that great and most of the time you'll probably end up being more of an annoyance than an actual threat I have to place it in the djer trust me I want this gun to be good but it just really isn't you're pretty much better off using any other of the lights weapons right now I've always said that the only thing holding the v9s back was the muzzle climb and the sze for this weapon being absolutely horrible but with the Red Dot site added the season that has been fixed and now that the xp54 has been nerfed it really doesn't have much competition anymore to be be considered one of the best light weapons at the moment they did change the fire rate recently but they uped the damage to compensate I heard some of yall were binding fire weapon to scroll wheel and that's why the change was made regardless the gun is super good right now I'm going to place it in the S tier the sh1 1900 is one of those high-risk High reward guns that is really powerful in the right hands but can also get you killed the damage potential for this gun is insane but you do kind of have to be right in the enemy's face to make use of it which is very dangerous for light I'm going to place it in the a tier the matter is a gun that wishes it could be the model but unfortunately just doesn't quite reach that Mark it's still a decent gun but the damage is worse than the S off and you'll pretty much always be better off just running the model instead if you want to use a shotgun with a little bit of range on it I'm going to place it in the B tier but if the model ever gets nerfed or this gun gets buffed I might place it a bit higher the xp54 really got hit hard this season with the damage being decreased by two per bullet now that doesn't sound like much but it's actually a lot it's still a fairly consistent gun it's just no longer consistent at getting kills I'd place it in the low a tier for now but I would really recommend that for the most part you use something like the v9s in ranked for now if you're playing light the M11 has risen up a little bit in the meta now that the xp54 has been nerfed and while it hasn't exactly taken its place or risen to the xp54 former power it's gotten a new Red Dot site and it's doing pretty well this season i' plac this weapon in the a tier the sr84 has never been good in cash out and the only point where it was a problem was in terminal attack and an annoyance in power shift it's still easily stopped by any Shields and now it has to contend with the lh1 now having a scope and mediums having the pike not to mention that it is no longer hit scan past 40 m and the scope is still weird making it so that there's not really any reason to run this gun at the moment it's going to have to go into the D tier unfortunately the amount of effort that you have to put in to do well with this gun is usually better used with something else dagger did get a buff this season that allows you to hold down the backstab button for as long as want which is pretty cool but unfortunately when there's lots of really good close-range weapons the dagger just ends up not doing as well the dagger also thrives off of chaos and doesn't Faire as well in the final round I'd place it in the C tier and Mark if you want to make people use this weapon without having to BU it I suggest adding a camit skin to the game I know I'd definitely be using it the sword is easily the best melee weapon in the game not only because of its high damage profile but because it's really hard to hit a good sword player especially one with Evas of Dash this is easily the most viable melee weapon with people even being successful with it in high level ranked I'm going to put it at the top of a tier I wouldn't necessarily disagree with you if you consider this weapon to be S tier but for me personally I find that if you have decent enough aim and good positioning you're able to counter this weapon the knives have been a bit interesting they don't require a Reload but they need to hit head shot to compete with the other light weapons in ttk values and they also are a projectile weapon Heavies that use melee weapons or flamethrower will probably think that this weapon is busted but in ranked I almost never never see this weapon used anymore there's just better options I'd put it in the B tier lh1 isn't a bad gun but at the moment it's kind of outclassed by the pike it did have a scope added to it which is nice and it's still a solid weapon but in the current meta there are usually better options I'd place it in the B tier and if it gets a buff or the pike gets nerfed I could see it getting placed higher and that's my tier list for this season I hope you all found this informative let me know in the comments what you think of it subscribe for mostly weekly videos on the finals and I'll see you next time,"The user didn't specifically mention the CL-40 grenade launcher in their text. However, they did mention a few other weapons and their rankings in the game. They think the M60, despite its increased fire rate and the addition of an equipable Red Dot site this season, struggles at range and is overall an 'A' tier weapon. They classify the throw as a 'C' tier weapon citing its low DPS and range issues. The MGL, according to them, is inconsistent and needs a rework or a buff, but it's fun to use and can cause significant structural damage, placing it at the bottom of the 'C' tier. Lastly, the Lewis gun is deemed fantastic, especially with new recoil changes, but the user doesn't provide a tier for this weapon. Player feedback indicates that the CL-40 grenade launcher is one of the best weapons for the Heavy class in 'The Finals'. It is praised for its consistency, good range, and improved recoil management. Despite the popularity of the Dual 50s, the CL-40 retains a strong position and is ranked in the S tier.

Analyses of other weapons show varying opinions. The KS23, while requiring precise aim and management of bullet travel and drop-off, is noted for its ability to significantly damage the arena and its synergy with the Winch Claw. It is placed in the A tier.

The SA 12 is considered one of the top overall guns, lauded for its quick time-to-kill against light and medium opponents. Even though using it alongside the Mes Shield is not as strong as it once was, it's still highly regarded, being placed near the top of the A tier.

The Sledgehammer, once dominant in casual lobbies, has seen a drop in popularity due to its struggle against movement abilities and gadgets, and the more ranged-focused meta this season. It's ranked in the B tier.

The Spear is seen as somewhat subpar, with its only advantage over the Sledgehammer being its slightly longer range. Its inconsistent hit registration and lack of utility relative to the Sledgehammer lead to its placement in the C tier.

Finally, the new akimbo pistols are praised for their style, range, manageable recoil, and damage output. However, they require a The CL-40 grenade launcher was initially considered to be too powerful by many players after a buff at the beginning of the season. This led to it being nerfed in the latest update, reducing the total damage and splash damage, and increasing the self-damage. However, the max size was increased by one. 

Several strategies have been identified to counter the CL-40, such as using APS height and getting close to the CL-40 user. As a result, it is not viewed as a significant threat if players know how to deal with it. Despite potential annoyance when fighting grenade launchers, the CL-40 is not considered to be particularly strong. After these latest changes, it has been placed into the C tier. 

Overall, there seems to be a balance in the game with regards to medium class weapons. The player's choice depends more on individual play style or the specific situation. The CL-40 grenade launcher in 'The Finals' has received mixed opinions about its performance. Some players praise its solid performance, noting that if style were a factor, it would be an S-tier weapon. It is considered a good close-range option in the medium's loadout, especially when paired with the dematerializer, creating a strong combination. 

However, there are criticisms about its range, which is perceived to be insufficient. This deficiency, along with the presence of the pike which outperforms the CL-40 in every category, has resulted in some players placing the weapon in the B-tier. They believe the CL-40's performance is not as effective as they had hoped, despite the addition of a new sight in the recent season. 

The weapon's balancing is seen as needing some improvement. Despite it being a decent weapon, it does not measure up to the competition provided by other medium assault rifles, particularly after their nerfing. 

Overall, the CL-40 grenade launcher is viewed as a solid weapon with good close-range potential, but is outperformed by other options in the medium class, namely the pike. Its lack of range and the existence of more potent options have led to some disappointment among players who had high hopes for the weapon. I'm sorry, but the text you provided doesn't include any specific opinions about the CL-40 grenade launcher in the game 'The Finals'. Could you please provide some relevant information or reviews about the CL-40 grenade launcher? The user doesn't provide a direct opinion on the 'CL-40 grenade launcher' in the text provided. The text discusses other weapons like the xp54, v9s, M11, sr84, lh1, pike, dagger, and sword, but does not mention the 'CL-40 grenade launcher.' 

The user suggests that the xp54 has been nerfed and is not as effective anymore, but the M11 has risen up in the meta due to the nerfing of the xp54. The sr84 is considered not good and is easily stopped by shields, the Dagger is noted to have been buffed but still struggles in chaos and final rounds, whilst the sword is considered the best melee weapon due to its high damage profile and difficulty to hit a good sword player. 

However, without context or direct mention of the CL-40 grenade launcher, it's impossible to provide a detailed opinion or analysis of this weapon. The user does not provide a direct opinion about the CL-40 grenade launcher in the game 'The Finals'. They discuss the vas of Dash as the most successful melee weapon even in high-ranked levels, considering it an A-tier weapon. They find that with good aim and positioning, this weapon can be countered. The user also talks about the knives, which are projectile weapons that don't require a reload but need headshots to compete with other light weapons. They find that the weapon is not popular in ranked games and there are better options, placing it in the B tier. The user mentions the lh1 gun, which is outclassed by the pike but still a solid choice. They consider it as a B-tier weapon that could potentially move higher with a buff or if the pike gets nerfed. Their overall opinion on weapon balancing seems to be that while some weapons are viable and effective, there are often better options available."

The Finals best weapons season 4,Hl0vLAVvlcU,The Ultimate Weapon Tier List: Ranking Every Gun in The Finals Season 4!,holy moly guacamole not another tier list for the finals but hey contestants this is not your grandma's tier list I've got nearly a thousand hours in the game and while I may not be Pro when I'm not playing or making YouTube videos I'm watching the pros I'm like steady glued to Twitch and YouTube all so I can learn the tricks and the tips and the whole thing so you don't have to do it as much so without further Ado this is going to be a little bit different of a tier list it's not going to be your standard s and your letters and your A's and your B's and your C's and your D's this is going to be something practical so first I'm going to tell you how I base uh my thought process on where I'm going to put these weapons for each class now what I'm thinking about is Success potential okay success potential in our Lord and savior game type cash out that is the only game type that matters when it comes comes to the finals yes other game types can be fun like Powers shift but other game types shouldn't even be allowed to breathe not looking at you ta not looking at you bro but cash out is what we're going to be talking about here in terms of the weapon selection are things viable in other playlists of course are things fun to play absolutely but I'm talking about success potential I'm talking about weapons that are going to contribute most to helping you win and of course honestly things that are going to help you win in cash out are probably going to be pretty viable in something like Powers shift or banket now here are the categorize AKA categories we've got supreme we've got great pretty good meh needs work and then our specialist category so Supreme means that it's probably uh the weapon of choice at the tippity top of the spear the 0.1% scent the high EO the rubies the emeralds well maybe not so much Emerald cuz that's just about kind of grinding I guess but yeah so the LIE commits the bizes all those people who stream and they're just at the tippy top of the spear that's what they're using that's what they're trying to exploit AKA have to use to be that good it's going to be really viable it might be tough to learn the weapon or do really well with the weapon but it's probably going to have a pretty high success potential being is at the high e guys are the ones who are using those weapons now great means it's probably really good it can be great in a lot of situations it's got like high variability in terms of like application to uh winning a match and it may not have just an incredibly steep Le learning curve so yeah great going to apply to a lot of things pretty good are weapons that are pretty good like you can make them work you can do well with them although they might have some limitations in certain scenarios and then we have meh you know these these weapons are me you know like I don't know if you really want to use them you can and you can win with them but you know I don't know me and then we've got our needs work category these are the trash of the trash weapons the these are the just trashiest don't even like why Embark please let's do something with these we get they need a they need a rework they need changes big Chang changes and then you have the last category which which I put on here was Specialists where in the right hands these weapons are gangster they can really really run a muck cause havoc and chaos but it's not for everybody if you're brand new to the game and you're wearing the default skin probably don't pick these up if you spent thousands of hours playing that one weapon you're a certified G you can I tip my hat to thee and you can win at anything doing anything so yeah you're you're awesome all right now let's just jump right into the first one I'm going to start from the bottom I'm going to work our way up by by that I mean needs work I might sprinkle a little specialist kind of item in here or there but the first item on the list that I think needs work is going to be the 93r and I'm going to put this in the needs work I definitely think that they need to revisit how the 93r operates within the game I know I've read some Dev notes kind of them being worried about it it having the you know the the burst weapon and if they raise the damage of the burst it basically Two Shots lights in the head really really quickly but I say let's do it like let's go make this thing as at least as powerful as the Famas cuz it's kind of like the lights version of the Famas it historically like when this weapon first came out it was absolute trash it's ever so slightly better now but I still think in once compared to its per the 93r needs a it it just simply needs another look all right now the next one up in our needs work category is going to be drum roll please maybe chicka chicka the dual blades yeah yeah I'm pretty sure you agree on this I don't think that's a hot take I'm pretty sure I've looked at Reddit once or twice and you don't even see a whole lot of dualblade users now I have met some people who are really good like Leah Nardo Style with the dual blades but not enough where I think that it deserves to go in the specialist category and so I'm going to put it in the needs work category cuz I would like to see the sword Masters the medium sword Masters have their day and I don't think that day has quite come yet now here's the thing next up on the needs work category it's honestly going to be another medium weapon what do you think it's going to be well it's the pistol yeah I'm thinking this hand Cannon this Clint Eastwood style you know you feel lucky punk probably yeah if you have that weapon I feel actually feel pretty lucky that you're on the other team because I'm going to smoke you now this is a cool idea can it hit hard yeah it can but just really inconsistent uh not not really great I don't I don't think that it's good really for much of anything except for allowing me to stomp on you when you're on the team so yeah that that I think that needs work and last but not least uh the one of the last things that I'm going to put in the needs work category is going to be the grenade launcher for the heavy guys uh you heavy Mains out there who like to use the GL you are absolutely insane what is wrong with you somebody needs to like are you wearing a helmet out in public yes stop like who does this man I I this is the 0% of you Heavies out there that use this weapon I never see it and and gosh if you like if you've used it you know why but bless your heart if you do Embark themselves have admitted that this weapon that needs it needs a second look um now let's see what I'm going to go with let's should we do one in the specialist category let's do one in the specialist category I'm going to throw the sword the light sword in the specialist category now remember I'm kind of comparing everything in terms of like uh against of course the other weapons that the light does offer and then success potential for the Cash Out mode now the light this this thing about the light sword is it's it's it's inhibiting right because you literally cannot engage in anything outside of a close range fight which is tough for a light when you've got only 150 HP baby like you're not even worthy of a heel beam son so you know like okay you forcing that close-range jazz now I will say I have seen some lights use Dash a little bit of camo bomb sprinkled on top with the sword lunge and they've just mastered it like you can be a lethal demon with the sword but you got to put the hours in that's just my two cents that's my opinion now moving on and remember I'm I'm this is all about success potential in cash out so this might be a hot take but I'm going to put throwing knives in the meh category all right now I have had a ton of fun with throwing knives that's not to say that I haven't made some kids cry and maybe Powers shift but in cash out it's a little more difficult to make these viable especially uh when they've kind of nerfed them a little bit there was a moment in time in season 3 where these things were just gangster they were straight wrecking fools left and right turning kids into trophies like nobody's business but they brought them they reeled it in a little bit and and I think maybe rightly so and uh you know that while these may be fun when we're talking about success potential and really contributing to your team to get that W I'm going to put him in the meh category let me let me know what you think there now the next weapon I'm going to put in the me is another light weapon and that's going to be the sniper rifle I'll use sniper kids out there you had your hearts punctured when uh you know Embark nerfed the sniper rifle recently where they made it like hit scan and then also not hit scan so it's got like trajectory Beyond 40 m and then anything under that going to be a hit scan weapon so that's kind of weird that they did that I'm not I've not seen too many developers like split one weapon into two different mechanisms of which they operate but I a highly situational weapon here uh you know in when you're playing cash out you just can't sit on a high point you know 100 met away like you little poers shift punks and just try to pick people off like you got to get up in people's business and in people's faces when the cash outs are inevitably inevitably going to be inside a building without line line of sight now I almost wanted to put this in the specialist category um but I'm definitely going to go with the meh because I think you know it you can you can in you can kind of have an effect on winning a cash out with this and but it could all this could also just basically be in the specialist category but but you know yet again even even people who are super cracked with it I think you're better off picking a different different weapon like if you're really good with the snipe I bet you're even better with some of the weapons that I'm going to rate higher in this tiered list all right so next up in the me category I'm going to put the flamethrower yep yep you heard it here Johnny storms you Johnny Storm Heavies out there now the flamethrower is near and dear to my heart especially when we used to be able to juggle the mesh now I probably contributed single-handedly or multi-hand to the devs nerfing the mesh Shield so you can't you can no longer juggle it cuz I was just I loved abusing that I don't even think it's abusing I think it's a mechanism of the game like some 40 chest big brain move cuz i' pull that uh that flamethrower and I would juggle that mesh to close the gap maneuver a AB ility I could get in range with the flames and just cook him up a little shrimp on the barbie especially for all you lights if I saw a Lobby full of Lights I was pumped cuz I know I'm cooking but remember we're comparing this to trying to win in cash out and you know that's the mecca of the finals and I'm going to put this in the meh category next for me in the meh category we've got another heavy weapon and that's going to be the ks2 23 folks the ks23 this thing is no also known as the sniper shotgun now I was kind of bummed to see that we didn't get a scope for this shotgun with season 4 that would have been freaking hilarious and awesome but you know this again for me is kind of a meh uh it's it's situational it does have some really good map destruction uses usages for it but it's a projectile slug I mean it's just got some things that kind of hold it back for me me for for being any better than a meh you know what I mean all right so next up on the list what I think is another meh is going to be the heavy spear uh there's just you know I'm comparing it to other melee type weapons within the heavy class and y'all know that there's the it's MC Hammer time it's if if if I'm choosing between the spear or the hammer I'm Going Hammer every time and there's reasons for that the AOE thing on here is like not that strong it's not worth what it does to you in terms of like slowing you down and getting you caught up in the animation and things like that so that for me the spear is just going to go in the meh class ooh ooh and you know what this was I kind of went back and forth I forgot we're going to backtrack a little bit in the needs work cuz I think originally I was going to put this in the meh and and maybe I could still meh this but also maybe I could definitely do this in the needs work I'm going to go ahead and run with meh and uh and and you guys tell me what you think but I'm going to put the riot shield Rage Against the Machine Quiet Riot is a big time meh for me now the reason why I think this might outdo the dual blades a little bit is because you you know there was that I can't remember what that cat's name was but he literally made it to Diamond using nothing but the riot shield and like heal beams and he was solo queuing ah man that dude was a certified G I can't remember what his channel was man shout out I'm sorry I can't give you a proper shout out but the thing about the riot shield is you can protect other teammates during Steals and things like that although I kind of feel like there's still a really good chance that this should be in the needs work category but I'm going to leave it in the meh for now so after having said that let's do another specialist huh let's sprinkle another specialist category or weapon in there and and for me I'm going to put the dagger I want to put the dagger in the specialist category again because in the right hands this thing is bananas you can actually uh you can get if you backstab somebody you're straight you know removing them from the game however you don't even have to be on the back side of somebody you can literally pull off a backstab registration by hitting them on the side so either side of their body will actually give you the backstab rge and you will just turn them straight into a coin purse another thing that they changed with this and this might be a hot take is they allowed you to like queue up the super charged backstab so you can kind of like hold that button and then like Dash around while it's queued and get yourself in just the right spot to go ahead and let go and then poof they're gone Abracadabra right so I'm going to put that in the specialist because this ain't for everybody folks again if you're default skin don't touch this thing uh but well I guess you got to start somewhere so yeah maybe touch it if you really want to commit but you got to commit to make this thing legit all right now let's see I think we're done with the meh so I'm going to move into to the pretty good category pretty good for me first up we'll go ahead and hit it with the M26 matter a new season 4 weapon new and improved from the other shotgun that the light has I don't know we'll talk more about that later what I think this is is a little bit more of a lackluster uh model 1887 the medium shotgun it feels a lot like it it plays kind of like it but just not as good the bullet spread uh with this shotgun is not as tight as the model it doesn't have actually the that the model has and I don't feel like it hits quite as hard but it does feel a lot like it and you can be pretty good with this weapon especially if you're good with Mobility with the light um if you equip Dash and you kind of use that those moments in time between shot because there is a little bit of some latency between every shot that you take if you use that to mobilize yourself reposition and buck off another shot you can really decimate somebody so this weapon's definitely not bad um it's not great and it can be a lot of fun so there's that next up oh man how the mighty have fallen the once all greatness of the xp54 this I would say there was a time where I would think this is this was Supreme the xp54 was a giant it was extremely versatile it had great range it had good hipfire this thing to me for cash out in light it was like it went hand in hand but it recently took what I what I think is a pretty big Nerf to the damage which every bullet on a on a SMG to take damage is huge because you've got so many bullets per second so this thing took a pretty big hit and I I I I definitely think that it's it's moved itself down a couple of rungs I don't even think this is great anymore let me know what you think in the comments but that's where I'm putting the xp54 next up here is a weapon that was like in the needs work category and then for just a minute it was in the great category and now I'm putting it in the pretty good category and that is the cl40 so at the beginning of season 4 this thing was just shining baby it was glittery all the cl40 users out there that have been riding a CL train since the beginning oh man you guys are also insane how did you do it but you had your time to shine at the beginning of season 4 this thing was legit you could just straight Molly wamp fools with the cl40 then couple weeks ago they walked it back a little bit and you know I actually made a video about that and I still think the cl40 is pretty good I could I still have a good time with it I can definitely get in the double digit kills with a positive KD and contribute to a win with the CL uh so you know what that's where I'm putting that it's pretty good ah back to how the mighty have fallen oh the Once Upon a Time King the F car the medium assault rifle this thing was an absolute lazy back in the day I mean if you had this and you could shoot you could control that recoil your name was Willie cuz you were be now not so much they kind of tried to add some bullets to it but they lowered the damage they made they did make the recoil pattern more pattern more difficult this weapon is not what it once used to be and uh there's definitely something that's that we got a new uh admission to the medium uh weapon choice that just further puts this thing into the ground so that's where the F car goes these days in my book next up on pretty good is actually going to be let's see oh hot take I'm going to put the Louie gun with the heavy the heavy Louie gun is pretty good and again I'll remind you I'm comparing it to its peers so I'm comparing it to the other lmg that the heavy has and then it's contribution to a w this thing hits but when you look at the ttks when measured against the M60 they are nominal we're talking milliseconds and so for that reason I'm putting it in pretty good I will talk more about that when we rate the M60 and more comparisons to the lou gun so enough for now though that's where I'm putting that bad boy next up I'm pretty good I'm actually going to do hammer when you pair the Hammer with the right load out and the right person who really knows how to work that load out honestly Hammer goo gun as a specialization Hammer uh charging slam or Hammer winch Club I think are all really good pairs along with some other utilities and gadgets if you know what you're doing with this Hammer thing man it's pretty good even if you don't know what you're doing with the hammer thing it's also still pretty good you can do a lot of map manipulation you can play below you can play Above you can open up all these walls and these different Advantage points to get yourself into the cash out and if you're working with a team who knows what they're doing man you could I think you could really tear it up with this but it does have its limitations which why it stays in the pretty good next up and this might be hot take let me know what you think but I'm going to put the dues the 50 aimos for the heavy this this weapon it's I mean weapons but you know weapon whatever is it's sick the probably the coolest addition to the game like if we are rating these on cool Factor this is definitely s tier the Dual kimbos are super super cool they are fun to use uh but they're only pretty good in my opinion they've got some limitations uh you know the bullet spread and it's almost like r sometimes when when you're trying to it's shoot this weapon it's pretty random especially if you're moving uh so for that I'm going to put them there they're fun but you know they're just only pretty good in my opinion now let's get to great we'll start back at light oh whoa whoa whoa whoa skirt let's scoot back a little bit let's do another specialist I'm going to do the light double barrel shotgun as a specialist weapon man this thing is UN giving right you only got two shots in the barrel and the reload time is atrocious in fact my Tesla I don't know I actually don't own a Tesla but a Tesla can go 0 to 60 faster than you can reload this double b shotgun you know what I mean however having said that if you land your shots you are absolutely decimating the playing field I have seen a couple people who are just cracked with this thing just unravel an entire team they know how to move they know how to position they land their shots and it's just the it's absolutely devastating so for that I'm putting it in the specialist category all right moving on to great another light weapon is the v9s baby this thing is goed ever since the beta it has been a certified G in the beta it was a little better but it is still really really good right now you can just you know tap tap tap tap tap that finger for ultimate speed people were abusing that by hooking up the uh attack um to the to the mouse wheel and so they were like kind of abusing the their ability to maximize the RPM so they did Nerf the RPM but they bumped up the damage this thing is still legit I love it it's got pretty good range it's got great HTI fire I would say that this weapon is great next up for the uh what I think is still great is going to be the Famas but this is got a little bit of asteris in my opinion I think this weapon hits the Great tiered list when you put the scope on it baby so in season 4 we do get SES for a lot of the weapons the Famas greatly benefits from putting a scope or sight on it it feels like almost like a Halo battle rifle um and it's got pretty good hit fire the scope lets you kind of get that little bit more distance in there and this thing is is a beast it can straight wreck if you know how to use it and is a great contribution to winning the match as a medium tell me I'm wrong you can't the next one is the tried and true the dusty the rusty akm this you know this is my gun and I am a medium and my medium is my gun I don't know there's like a marine thing there I've just totally butchered it however the Red Dot sites on this thing will help you butcher the other team if you know what I mean the akm is great it's got awesome hip fire it's got a little bit of a dicey recoil but it's really not that bad and this is just a great selection for mediums especially new mediums from the new to the VIP P's the akm is a great choice in my opinion next up we're going to go back to our discussion with the M60 so the heavy lmg M60 the reason why I think this better is better than the Louie is because when you look at the ttks the time to kill against light medium and heavy the differences between the M60 and the Lewis gun are milliseconds it's just it's just so nominal it doesn't even matter so the reason why the M60 wins in my opinion is not only did it get a sight this season so you can put a red dot on there which you can't with the Lewis gun it's got a ginormous clip ladies and gentlemen you got 70 bullets in the barrel and you could basically kill a medium you can kill two mediums a heavy and a light off of One Clip if you just nail all your shots it's out of control so you could just sit there and just stay and spray and prey that thing and just put down hella P per suppression fire for 4 days so for that for that reason I think right now the M60 is a better choice than the Lewis gun all right before we get into Supreme let's put our last weapon in the specialist list okay and for me it's going to be thebo that's right d like you know the Bears dbo anyway I'm putting the bow down here in the specialist territory because man Again difficult weapon to learn and to use it's got a lot of mechanics to it it can you can do a quick draw like a tap fire almost like with the b9s you can do a long draw so you can like the longer you hold it back you go to full maximum draw of which you'll get the max damage with the long draw you actually get it but it's got It's got bullet drop as well or quote unquote Arrow drop and so like at a distance you'll actually get Arrow Arc but if you hard pull it or you pull with the full draw you'll get less Arrow Arc it's just so many different kind of things to this mechanic of the bow that uh that make it kind of has a difficult learning curve curve bow bow curve curve bow if you will but um I have seen some people absolutely tear the floor up with the bow I think it can do a whole lot you can get in on people you can snipe people with this thing it's pretty legit it's just hard to master and so for that reason I'm putting it in the specialist now I don't know I don't know if it's just me or what but it's kind of interesting I'm now realizing that all of everything I put in the specialist in terms of weapons was light hm what do you think about that what does that say about me as a person anyways let's go now hey hey what we've all been waiting for hey it's the Supreme category you are going to rip and tear with these weapons right now you're going to do very well uh they're they're not super hard to learn uh well maybe maybe they are but this is what the top the people at the top of the ELO are really playing with and you can just crush with these weapons the first up is now the new king for the light it's going to be the M11 no this thing does not have range it's kind of almost a little bit of a situational uh weapon and also if you have the next weapon on our tier list in your back pocket it'll serve you right so but the M11 has really not been nerfed since I mean gosh I don't I don't even remember when the last time they if they even touched this thing correct me if I'm wrong maybe this has never been nerfed right now the damage is crazy it absolutely dissolves people Thanos Thanos snap finger snap style this thing can straight cut people's heads right off figuratively like in the game gaming World cuz these are VR people they're not real so it's cool to say that but yeah M11 is just an absolute Beast right now pick this weapon get some Mobility even invis uh or Dash either way you're going to crush the next one up might have a little bit of a learning curve there's some visual recoil to this and kind of to get the vibe of this weapon and the hitfire isn't the absolute best it's nowhere near the hitfire of the M11 of course but the lh1 for the light especially if you put the scope on this thing I have been absolutely shredding this thing I'm like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 Super Shredder with this bad boy you can crush with this with the I I mean I've got I've got the hang of the hipfire so I can take some close-up battles but it's got mad range you put the scope on this thing baby and it's call it a day so right now I think the M11 and the lh1 for the light are Supreme next up I'm going to put nobody's surprise here we've got the model 1887 for the medium this has been gangster for a very long time if I'm not correct me if I'm wrong here but I'm pretty sure this weapon has never been nerfed and it just hits it slaps as the kids would say you can I'll tell you this don't ads with it it's not going to help you it doesn't really tighten up the spray spray pattern at all it gives you a lot of Mobility while you're shooting and it just straight wrecks people you get the timing down and you know everybody at the the tip of the spear here in terms of like the High ELO uh mediums in ranked the diamonds they using the model baby the model is certified G next up but a new contender in the field is going to be the pike 556 now they just recently nerfed this thing but I will tell you it is still a certified G it is like an lh1 for the medium it's got a scope you can iron sight it it's got crazy range pretty it's like it's basically an lh1 for the medium and it rips it shreds it is evaporating people everybody's like if you're top ELO in the diamonds you either have to play it or you're playing the model and that's pretty much it

text doesn't specifically mention the CL-40 grenade launcher or give any detailed opinions about weapon balancing. The user seems to be introducing a tier list for the game 'The Finals' based on their experience and the perceived 'success potential' of different weapons in the game type 'cash out'. They mention categories from supreme to specialist but don't discuss any specific weapons. To get more detailed feedback on the CL-40 grenade launcher, you might need to look elsewhere or ask the user directly. This opinion does not seem to directly mention the CL-40 grenade launcher. However, a general framework for weapon analysis and categorization is given. Here's how the weapons are categorized:

1. ""Great"" weapons are those that are highly viable and versatile. They may require some skill to master but offer high success potential. They're being used by high-level players, indicating that they're highly effective.

2. ""Pretty good"" weapons are reliable and can be used effectively in most situations, but may have some limitations in certain scenarios.

3. ""Meh"" weapons are considered mediocre and may not be the best choice for players. They can be used to win, but they're not highly recommended.

4. ""Needs work"" category includes weapons that are considered to be poorly balanced or ineffective. The critique suggests these weapons need to be reworked or improved.

5. ""Specialists"" category includes weapons that are highly effective in the hands of skilled players who have spent a lot of time mastering them. They're not recommended for new players.

This framework can be used to analyze the CL-40 grenade launcher, but this specific weapon isn't mentioned in the given text. The text does not provide specific comments or opinions about the CL-40 grenade launcher for the game 'The Finals'. The discussion revolves around other weapons such as the 93r, dual blades, and a pistol. The user suggests that the 93r needs a revisit in terms of its damage output and balance, similar to the Famas. The dual blades are also seen as needing work, with fewer users and a less impactful role in the game. The pistol is criticized for being inconsistent and not good for much except giving the opponent an advantage. It's suggested that these weapons need balancing to make them more competitive and appealing to players. The commenter seems to have a negative opinion about the CL-40 grenade launcher, which is utilized by the heavy class in the game. They indicated that it is rarely used by players and even questioned the sanity of those who choose this weapon. The game developers, Embark, have also acknowledged that the grenade launcher needs improvement.

The commentator also mentioned the light sword for the specialist class. They noted it is a risky weapon due to its close-range necessity and the lower HP of the light class. However, they acknowledged that if mastered, it can be potent. 

The commentator discussed their mixed feelings about throwing knives, which they believe are fun but not particularly effective, especially after recent nerfs. They suggested that these weapons are less viable in the game mode, Cash Out. 

Overall, the commentator appears to have concerns about weapon balancing in 'The Finals', particularly with the underpowered CL-40 grenade launcher and the situationally effective light sword and throwing knives. The player's opinion about the CL-40 grenade launcher in 'The Finals' game seems to be mixed. While they acknowledge that there was a period in Season 3 where the launcher was very powerful and effective at taking out enemies, the player states that the developers have since made changes that have decreased its potency. The player believes that these changes were necessary for the overall balance of the game.

The player categorizes the grenade launcher as 'meh', implying that while it can be fun to use, it does not greatly contribute to a team's success or the player's ability to secure a win. They suggest that the grenade launcher's effectiveness may not be consistent and its usefulness can vary depending on the situation in the game.

Regarding the sniper rifle, the player seems to be disappointed with the recent changes made by the developers, Embark. The changes have split the weapon's operation into two mechanisms, based on distance, which the player finds odd. They consider the sniper rifle to be highly situational, and not suitable for all game modes, such as Cash Out.

They were considering categorizing the sniper rifle as 'specialist', but ultimately decided to also put it in the 'meh' category, as they believe there are other weapons in the game that players could use more effectively.

Initially, at the start of season 4, the weapon was perceived as excellent, allowing players to easily dominate opponents. It was described as shining and glittery, and those who used it from the beginning were praised for their skill. However, a couple of weeks into the season, the developers tweaked the CL-40, reducing its effectiveness slightly. Despite this, the weapon is still considered pretty good by players, who note that they can still achieve double-digit kills with a positive K/D and contribute to a win. Overall, despite the nerf, the CL-40 remains a popular choice, considered above average but not as powerful as it once was. 

On the other hand, the F car, a medium assault rifle, was criticized for its reduced damage and increased difficulty in controlling recoil. Despite an attempt to add more bullets, the reduced damage output and more complicated recoil pattern have lessened its effectiveness, leading to the weapon being deemed not as good as it once was.

They also talked about the V9S weapon, stating its effectiveness since the beta and how it has good range and great HTI fire. The Famas was also mentioned, noting that it hits the Great tiered list when a scope or sight is attached, comparing its feel to a Halo battle rifle. The user has a positive opinion about the CL-40 grenade launcher, stating that it's a powerful weapon that can greatly contribute to winning a match if used correctly. The user believes it's an excellent choice for medium class players and it's particularly effective when used with a scope to increase its range.

The user also discusses their views on other weapons in the game. They enjoy using the AKM, praising its effective hip fire and red dot sights. Although they note its recoil can be difficult to manage, they still think it's a great choice for medium class players, especially those who are new to the game.

The user praises the M60 heavy lmg for its large clip size and the ability to equip a red dot sight. They believe it's superior to the Lewis gun due to these features, and the minimal differences in time to kill between the two weapons. The user emphasizes the M60's ability to suppress enemies and potentially eliminate multiple opponents with a single clip.

Lastly, the user mentions the bow as a specialist weapon, but doesn't provide a detailed opinion about it. The user has a mixed opinion about the CL-40 grenade launcher. They mention that it has a difficult learning curve due to many mechanics involved, including quick draw, long draw, bullet drop, and arrow arc. The user notes that these mechanics make it challenging to master, but if a player can overcome these challenges, the weapon can be quite powerful and versatile in action. They've seen players ""tear the floor up"" with it and use it to both get in close and snipe from a distance.

Despite these positives, the user places the CL-40 in the 'specialist' category, indicating they believe it's a weapon best suited for players who are willing to spend time mastering its unique mechanics.

They state that the M11 has not been nerfed recently, which might imply they feel it is currently a stronger, or at least more straightforward, choice than the CL-40. They didn't provide any direct comparison between the two weapons or explicit overall opinion about the CL-40's place in the game's balance. The text doesn't seem to contain any specific information or opinions about the CL-40 grenade launcher for the game 'The Finals'. The weapons discussed are the M11, the lh1, the Model 1887, and the Pike 556. The user praises the M11 for its significant damage and recommends it for its mobility. The lh1 is also commended for its range when a scope is attached. The Model 1887 for medium class is considered a consistent high performer that hasn't been nerfed. The Pike 556, despite a recent nerf, is still considered a strong contender. However, there are no mentions or opinions about the CL-40 grenade launcher.

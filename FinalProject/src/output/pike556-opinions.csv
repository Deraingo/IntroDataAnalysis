The Finals Season 4,RAVyAwBl32Q,Is The Finals Being Gatekept? (Season 4),in today's video I kind of want to go a little off the cuff I'm not going to add any infographics no fancy editing just me talking to you about some thoughts bouncing up here in my Noggin I've seen more than enough posts on Reddit as well as comments on my YouTube videos saying the same things as to why this game is not doing as well as it should reasons such as having subpar quality the balancing sucks too many cheaters and monetization is horrible when the reality of it is some of these statements are far from the truth and the rest are problems that every FP s has to an even higher degree the quality of this game in my opinion is in a league of its own with a team that is significantly smaller than that of a major AAA Studio the balancing is always being modified because they are actually listening to the players regardless if the suggestions are good or bad now they might not give you exactly what you want as an individual but the fact is they're listening to what the majority of the player base want and saying that they don't listen at all is a grossly false statement at the least as for cheaters please tell me what game is completely free of them while you're at it please tell me what game you can manly report them to Discord where a person can actually take a look at the evidence I'll wait because I don't know if it's just me but whenever I've reported a cheater in game three out of five times I would get a confirmation within the next week that they've been banned now if you are an ordinary player that reports someone in Apex Legends good luck because you're more than likely going to see that player in the top 700 at the end of the season facing no repercussions whatsoever and hell in war zone you could even make a career out of cheating in fact the finals has taken the first steps to combat software such as rewas to which other games had to take notice and start following suit I can go on and on about this topic but trust me the grass is not greener on the other side believe that and as for monetization the prices are not only fair but they even allow you to buy particular items from a bundle that you want rather than the entire bundle itself and for this current Halloween event you have the opportunity to get 27 free rewards and these rewards are not just stickers or charms some are actually quality skins whether or not the player is actually able to obtain them all is a different story but still the fact of the matter is there is a ways and means of potentially receiving them for free in contrast to apex's collection event which gives you a charm sticker or depending on how much they've pissed off the player base maybe even a skin now that we have a little perspective it is in my opinion that these are not the reasons why the finals is not doing as well as it should it is simply because players don't want to throw away the skill acquired from the game they are currently playing just to start all over again from scratch with something new even if that new game is Superior in every single aspect the majority of players just don't want to throw away that time invested this is particularly because of the increasingly competitive culture we live in today where everyone wants to be a well-known streamer or the best esport athlete known to man to sweat their balls off with the best of them and playing the game is for potential monetization rather than just for the fun of it this is blatantly clear with the abundance of TTV or kick names that you see in every other match no offense to anyone that does stream but this is just the reality of things because in order for this game to really find huge success is for one of the big four to fail which is Apex fortnite Call of Duty or OverWatch I know there are a lot of other huge titles but these are the most similar in terms of gameplay to the finals my point being is that Embark needs to play a game of patrici by making sure that the finals is in a great state so that when not if one of these big four fail the finals will be ready to receive a huge chunk of the players in the power vacuum the game Left Behind allowing it to finally achieve the recognition it deserves now failing can come in many ways not just by low player population it can also come in the way of people just having enough enough of their money time and effort being taken advantage of and when that time comes the finals will be waiting for them with open arms so if you're a player that's sitting on the fence thinking to yourself I don't know if I want to give this game a solid chance because I've invested way too much time in a particular game I want you to remember this because it took me a while to realize it as well that the fundamentals of aim such as Target acquisition click timing and tracking are consistent throughout all these major titles some may heavily rely on one aspect than the others but in general if you have solid fundamentals of aim you can easily transfer skill from one game to another this is why players like shroud or ASU can hop on to almost any FPS and quickly be proficient at it because they're able to use their fundamentals to find similarities of skill to transfer from one game to another anyhow I'm starting to feel like I'm going on a tangent here and I don't want to keep rambling on but yeah what are your thoughts is it because of bigger games gatekeeping the finals or is it because of other factors that is preventing this game from reaching its true potential I love to hear from you but again keep it civil if you enjoyed this video please drop a like And subscribe for all things to fin us the rest of the video is just going to be game play so peace and love guys and I'll see you in the [Music] arena we play Hal and we in our bement until the to but [Music] [Music] this bement you [Music] [Music] n [Applause] [Music] be basement but you [Music] [Music] [Music] n [Music] we would go to school but I cuz it's hard to read when you got tired eyes [Music] [Applause] [Music],"The reviewer voiced their opinions about the game 'The Finals', focusing more on the overall game rather than specifically the Pike .556 weapon. They addressed common criticisms such as subpar quality, poor balancing, cheating, and monetization. However, they disagreed with these criticisms. According to them, the quality of the game is excellent, especially considering the team behind it is smaller than a major AAA studio. They also appreciated the developers' efforts in continuously modifying the game balance based on players' feedback. 

The reviewer also pointed out that cheating is a common issue in all games, but 'The Finals' has a process where players can manually report cheaters to Discord. They praised the game for being proactive in banning cheaters, mentioning that they have received confirmation of action taken against cheaters three out of five times they reported. 

In terms of monetization, they did not touch on this topic explicitly, but it seems that they view the problems in 'The Finals' as common across all games, or even worse in other games. They highlighted that 'The Finals' has taken steps against cheating software, setting an example for other games. 

Overall, the reviewer seemed to hold a positive view of 'The Finals', but did not provide any specific feedback or opinions on the Pike .556 weapon. The text doesn't provide specific opinions on the weapon balancing or on the pike .556 in the game 'The Finals'. The discussion is more focused on the game's monetization, events, player retention, and the state of the gaming industry. It mentions the fairness of prices and the possibility of buying individual items instead of entire bundles. The text also talks about the potential to get quality skins through free rewards. The reason why 'The Finals' may not be doing as well as it could be is attributed to players not wanting to abandon skills acquired from other games. The competitive culture and the desire to become a well-known streamer or esports athlete is also discussed. The text suggests that the game needs one of the big four games (Apex, Fortnite, Call of Duty, or Overwatch) to fail for it to find huge success. The provided text doesn't include any specific opinions about the weapon balancing or the Pike .556 in the game 'The Finals'. The text primarily discusses the potential for 'The Finals' to gain a larger player base if other major games fail to satisfy their players. The speaker also emphasizes the transferability of fundamental aiming skills across different games, and mentions well-known players like Shroud and ASU who can quickly master various games due to these transferable skills. This suggests that players might be able to quickly adapt to using the Pike .556 if their aiming skills are solid, but no explicit assessment of the weapon is provided. I'm sorry, but without any pre-existing context or text, I can't extract opinions or provide detailed information about the Pike .556 weapon in the game 'The Finals'. Please provide relevant information, comments or discussions for me to analyze."
The Finals medium class,J4hY5VI-IN0,Medium Builds and Strategies - The Finals Guides / How to Guides Season 3,medium being the in between pick doesn't have the more apparent advantages that come with having the largest Health pool like heavy or highest damage output like light stat-wise it's middle of the ground in every way average Mobility average Health average damage so it makes sense for someone that knows nothing about the game to dismiss Medium as a class or contestant that has no advantages to offer and rather choose between the high health and high defensive capabilities of heavy or the high damage and high mobility of light depending on their preferred play style just looking at basic numbers medium might appear to be a class that serves no purpose but anyone that's actually played the finals knows that's not true what separates each class more than just the numbers are their specializations and gadgets and when throwing these into the mix the class's identities become much more distinct as of season 3 medium has three specializations that in my mind create three distinctively different play styles to choose from there's a supportive SL healer option a defensive SL lockdown option and what I'd call a more Mobility SL damage focused option all of which I think are viable ways to play if they're paired with the right gadgets my three strategies may not Encompass all possible play Styles but it's what comes to mind when I see each specialization you you may have your own strategies that differ from mine the builds and strategies I'll be going over are made considering cash out as a primary game mode but two of these builds can also work in terminal attack my preferred play style and the one I'd like to highlight first is the supportive option this play style involves using the healing beam as your specialization along with at least two supportive gadgets we'll consider the third Gadget slot to be a flexible slot that can vary from round to round and this will be true for all of our builds the gadgets you'd want for this play style are ones that support your team in some way the no-brainer choice is the defib and to be honest I think the defib is such a great Gadget that it's hard not to put in every medium build and the second supportive Gadget is the jump pad it's a quick to place Gadget that anyone on your team can use and it comes in handy for the support strategy that I'll explain in a bit an alternative to the jump pad is of course the zip line which serves a similar purpose a preference for the jump pad over the zip line simply comes from the fact that the jump pad is faster to place and you don't move in a forced slow and predictable path like you would with the zip line although there are places that can be too high or too far away to reach with the jump pad making the zip line necessary at times for my Flex Gadget I usually default a frag grenade cuz I like to have throwables but depending on the situation glitch traps are a great choice I'd use glitch traps in situations where I'm playing against a lot of lights with cloaking device or evasive Dash or even against other mediums that are using healing beam and defib since those are the players that rely the most on having their specialization at the ready and one good trap can ruin their day other than that this is the one slot that can be used for whatever you'd like the strategy for the support play style is that you want to be more of a follower going along with your team wherever they'd like to go and keeping a close eye on them without physically being too close to them ideally if your group is dying you want to be the the last one down because you should be the one keeping them up it can be a bit tricky switching back and forth from playing this way and playing as if you don't have the heal beam since you have to remind yourself that your team should be doing most of the heavy lifting in the damage compartment and you should be behind them they're off to the side keeping them alive as you're following it's best to prioritize shooting at the same targets as your team and centure behind them this should mean you'll generally be taking less damage in fights and you'll be able to see your team's Health to know when a fight is going south and you need to switch to your healing beam the most important thing to note about playing with the healing beam as your specialization is that if you're healing someone there's no need need for you to be out in the open as well while they're taking damage if there's an opportunity to sit behind some form of cover while you're healing then do it there's no value in standing somewhere where you can get shot and you can't fight back knowing when to switch off of your weapon to your healing beam and taking a back seat is the key to making this play style work it comes from deciding in the moment whether it would be more beneficial to heal in a given situation or if it would be more beneficial to damage now as far as why the gadgets I mentioned work well at this play style is that the defib obviously can revive people making it ideal for a Healer and support Focus strategy and I don't think it needs much more EXP than that as far as the jump pad or zip line other than being a gadget that everyone on your team can use it's also just a great repositioning tool for you when as I described earlier you're healing and don't want to be standing out in the open it can help you reposition to a distance that still works with the healing beam while also giving you a good vantage point to help in fights from a distance which brings us to our ideal weapon choices if you're playing from a distance doesn't make sense to use weapons that don't have any range so weapons like the riot shield or dual blades just aren't a good fit for this play style but I won't say there's any Perfect Weapon choice so just choose what you like what makes this my preferred play style for medium is that it's only possible to play this way on medium medium is the only contestant in the game that can heal their team and's the only one that can perform an instant revive maybe others will be able to do this stuff in the future but we'll have to wait and see whereas you can argue that the other strategies that I'll be describing can be mimicked to an extent by the other two classes now onto my second play style the defensive or lock down option involves picking the guardian turret of course and defending the objective whether you're playing cash out or terminal attack it's much easier to set this up in terminal Tech during the defense pre-round phase but other than it being more difficult in cash out or on the offensive side of terminal attack to set up the play style remains pretty much unchanged the gadgets you'd want to use are gadgets that are ideal for locking down an objective most importantly gas mines gas mines are what I'd say are the best of the mines to use for this lock down play style and I'll go into more detail as to why when discussing the overall strategy our second Gadget will also be mines but this time it's a choice between explosive mines or glitch trps between the two I usually gravitate towards explosive mines because I prefer the extra damage over the ability denial and combined with the turret and gas mines you can end up getting eims sometimes without even having to do anything as I said for the build the third slot is your choice but as I also said it's hard for me not to choose the defib since there's no other alternative to what it can do that being said there are some other good choices here such as the aps turret to help protect your setup or the other set of Mines that you didn't choose for your second slot now the strategy that I find most effective for locking down an objective is placing your gas mines on the objective itself just in case it ends up shifting around or being dropped to another floor the gas not only provides more area denial for a lockdown build but also denies your opponents from taking the objective even if your team gets wiped if your opponents don't have a way to counter the gas this could be potentially waste five or more seconds of their time depending on when each mine gets triggered also take into consideration that it takes about 5 seconds for a Cash Out Steel to finish and you're adding extra waste of time on top of that with these gas mines to make matters worse for your opponent the added annoyance from the guardian turret and another set of Mines can make stealing an objective feel hopeless for explosive mind placements I found the best spots are right after someone turns a corner since this game can be really fast-paced especially when you're playing right on an objective most people aren't going to be taking the time to clear Corners before running in and I find more success placing them this way than at entry points like I more commonly see them placed with glitch shaps you should be more concerned about placing them in spots to cover as much area as possible and keep in mind that you don't have to place them in spots that people tend to walk in order to activate them with how they work now as far as turret placement goes priority number one is that it needs to be in a spot that covers as much of the room as possible and priority number two is that you want it in a spot where it's hard to get a good angle to destroy it a good placement is a balance between the two protecting an indoor objective is easier but this strategy can work with an outdoor objective as well just not as great turret has pretty great range and if you're placing gas mines on the actual objective as I described this can be enough to keep it locked down it's a lot trickier to place your other set of mins but it's better to place them than to not as far as weapon choices the only one that I might stay away from is the cl40 just to not accidentally blow up any Minds I normally stick to ARS on medium but in theory the riot shield can work really well with this play style the only downside being when you don't have an objective you're locking down you're now stuck with a weapon that has no range a good alternative would be the model 1887 which has a surprising amount of range but it's still most effective from short to medium distances My overall opinion on this play style is that while it's great I tend to be too impatient at times to want to sit in the room with the objective waiting for people to push in so if you have a similar problem maybe try one of the other two play Styles instead okay now this last play style I haven't quite refined but I'd like to at least paint a picture of how it should work if played right it can be just as devastating as the other builds but it also has what I believe to be the biggest gap between skill floor and ceiling you'll be using the dematerializer as your specialization basically creating a build that makes you have extremely high area damage this build can also act as a counter to the lock down play style or any other team that's playing highly defensively the first first Gadget is going to be the frag grenade or pyro grenade and these are essential for tying this Build Together second will be explosive mines or gas mines but if you're using pyro grenades steer clear of using gas mines with them and your third Gadget can be a mine or throwable as well the defib or anything else you'd like but more mines or throwables would technically better complete the build the strategy is that you should be popping in and out of fights using the dematerializer to accomplish this and get a surprise angle or a quick escape on your opponents as you open your window with a dematerializer or find an existing opening for your surprise angle you'll have the opportunity to use a frag or pyro followed by your mind the frags with explosive minds work best for this strategy cuz if executed perfectly you can instantly delete someone or get them extremely low the frag will act as a Detonator for your mind rather than relying on the inconsistency of it getting tripped naturally you can also use the pyrro grenade as an alternative to the frag as a Detonator although it's a bit slower it's important to do this in the exact order I mentioned because the throwables take longer to throw than a mine takes the place saving you time and making it more difficult to get out of when doing it this way this is hard to pull off because you generally only get one opportunity to catch someone by surprise during a fight and swapping between your specialization two gadgets and then back to your weapon is a lot of inputs in a short time then of course if they move too much either only one or nothing will hit which is why this is great when playing against defensive teams chances are they'll have something placed down that can cause a chain reaction if you miss with your throwable while this can technically be done with any specialization being able to create an opening of your own means you can do this with more success than running into an existing opening and trying to toss a frag in mine at someone and since medium doesn't have any real ways to destroy walls other than the dematerializer at the moment it makes it the best choice if you're pulling off a quick escape the same thing can be done if your opponent tries to chase it catches people almost every time of course your priority should be to try and cut them off by closing a wall you've opened so they can't chase in the first place but if they do make it through you'll be ready tossing a throwable at your feet and then placing a mine shortly after Works nearly every time one of them will almost always hit this is way more consistent than the surprise angle it makes this build the best for personal survivability this build is centered around trying to wipe out a Target without giving them much of an opportunity to fight back which sounds great on paper but it is extremely difficult to pull off consistently I'm sure with enough practice ice though someone is going to get great at this if you prefer area denial over the high damage frag explosive mine combo then gas mines work better or pyrro grenades with explosive mines weapons of choice for this build are similar to The lockdown build anything works but unlike the lockdown build you want to blow up your mines so if the cl40 ever ends up getting a buff it would be absolutely deadly with this build the skill cing for this build is extremely high since a dematerializer is a very quick thinking specialization that requires a bit of creativity and you have to look at the maps and walls in a completely different way plus as I mentioned earlier swapping between your specialization two gadgets and your weapon it's a lot to do in a short time span I haven't used this build enough to claim I'm good at it but I know it can work better than I'm showcasing in this video to me medium specializes in filling in the gaps your team has whether that's a lack of Defense a lack of offense or a lack of support to tie your team together cuz more important than your own build Synergy is how well you're playing with your team despite medium's lack of High stats and health or damage you can make up for it with how you choose to play different players will gravitate towards a different one of these builds and because medium offers a taste of the other two classes with the defensive lockdown build and the ability damage build plus it has its own completely unique play style medium in my opinion is the best starter pick for anyone new trying to get into the game thanks for watching,"The review is extensive but it does not provide any specific opinions on the Pike .556 weapon in the game 'The Finals'. The player has detailed their strategies and opinions on the Medium class and its advantages, but no information is provided regarding the Pike .556. Therefore, no analysis can be made about this weapon based on the provided text. The user did not mention any specific opinions or feedback about the pike .556 weapon in 'The Finals'. The majority of the commentary is dedicated to strategic advice for medium builds, with a focus on using Gadget choices like the defib, jump pad, and zip line. They advised a support play style, staying close to the team and prioritizing healing over dealing damage. This player suggests using the defib and the jump pad for their speed and effectiveness in team support. They also mention the use of the frag grenade and glitch traps as a Flex Gadget depending on the situation. However, no specific opinions about the pike .556 weapon were provided in the given text. This excerpt does not provide any specific opinions or data on the pike .556 weapon for the game 'The Finals'. The passage mainly focuses on the strategy and play style of a healer/support role, mentioning the use of a healing beam, defibrillator, jump pad, and zip line. There is no mention of the pike .556 or any direct information regarding weapon balancing. The user has provided a detailed strategy for a defensive playstyle with the guardian turret but hasn't mentioned anything specific about the pike .556 weapon. Therefore, I cannot provide any opinions or details on the pike .556 based on the given text. The extracted text does not contain specific opinions or information about the pike .556 weapon in 'The Finals'. The opinions expressed focus on the game's strategy, specifically the best placements for mines and turrets to waste opponents' time and make stealing objectives difficult. The user also advises against using the cl40 weapon to avoid accidentally detonating any mines. The user typically prefers assault rifles for medium play but suggests that the riot shield might be a good fit for this strategy, despite its limitations when not holding an objective. However, no direct or detailed feedback is given for the pike .556 weapon. The review doesn't mention the pike .556 at all. It seems the player is focusing on different play styles and strategies, particularly one that involves high area damage, using mines, grenades, and a ""dematerializer"" specialization for surprise attacks or quick escapes. The player believes this strategy could be effective against defensive teams or those using a lockdown play style. The weapon mentioned is the model 1887, not the pike .556. The opinion on the Pike .556 weapon for 'The Finals' game seems to be quite detailed and strategic. The weapon seems to be used in a highly tactical manner that requires a lot of practice and precision to pull off effectively. The user seems to appreciate the Pike .556 strategy for its potential to surprise opponents and wipe them out before they have a chance to respond, especially when used against defensive teams. 

However, there are also challenges mentioned. Swapping between the weapon, two gadgets, and back to the weapon during a fight is difficult due to the high number of inputs required in a short time. It's also highlighted that the strategy's effectiveness can be undermined if the opponent moves too much, causing the player to miss their shots.

The player also mentions the use of the Pyrro grenade as a slower alternative to the Frag as a detonator. While this can be done with any specialization, the player suggests that it's most successful when creating an opening, rather than trying to infiltrate an existing one. 

As for the medium class, the player indicates that it lacks effective ways to destroy walls, with the exception of the dematerializer, which makes it the best choice for quick escapes. There's also a suggestion that this build is the best for personal survivability, hinting that the medium class, coupled with the Pike .556 and the mentioned strategy, is great for self-protection. 

However, the strategy is described as extremely difficult to pull off consistently, but The user doesn't specifically mention the Pike .556 weapon. They discuss various weapon and equipment combinations, mentioning the high-damage frag explosive mine combo, the gas mines, and the pyrro grenades with explosive mines. They express the potential advantage of the CL40 if it were to get a buff, implying that the current weapon balance may not be optimal.

The user also discusses the complexities and high skill ceiling associated with their particular build, which involves quick decision-making, creativity, and effective map usage. They admit to not being proficient with this build yet, suggesting there may be room for improvement or that it may be a more challenging build to master.

The user also touches on the role of the medium class in 'The Finals', describing it as a flexible class that can adapt to fill the gaps in a team, whether it be offense, defense, or support. They see the medium class as a good starting point for new players due to its versatility and the ability to try different play styles, despite its lack of high stats in health or damage. 

However, without specific mention of the Pike .556, it's difficult to extract their opinion on this particular weapon. The user's views on weapon balancing seem to revolve around the use of mines and grenades, rather than specific firearms."
The Finals medium class,81CpaQSUMG8,How to Win More with Medium Class – The Finals Pro Tips,medium is the most used Class in the finals right now I think and after close to 650 hours in the game I want to share the things I've learned Ming medium and high level lobbies but before you jump in the arena make sure you know what you're up against one of the things I like to do is check the leaderboard before getting into the game this way I know which classes I'm up against and I can choose my counter weapons and gadgets if I see a lot of lights in my Lobby for example I'll choose between the F card the revolver or the model 1887 because I counter best lights with those weapons one of the most interesting things I found about this game is how Embark managed to make the medium a support class while also acting as an assault class you can do just as much damage if not more than a heavy or light while still supporting your team more than they can this brings me to the heal beam I've seen a lot less medium players use the heal beam after their season 4 Nerf but it's still an extremely powerful tool for the medium class I'm sure we've all been against a three medium heal beam circle jerk before I'm back circle jerk circle jerk circle jerk circle jerk circle jerk but remember you don't always have to be aggressive as medium you can hang back with the heal beam and watch the show I'm healing you bro I'm healing you bro I'm healing you bro it's all you bro nice another thing you can do with the heal beam is the body block heal Strat that I'm sure you've all encountered before which is also really good for the last second steals but hey if you're not a heal beam guy that's okay with me you have to find the best specializations and gadgets that fit your play style I personally like to stay alive as long as I can so I've been using a lot of things to keep me alive like the goo grenade and dematerializer as of recent Staying Alive while dealing damage to your opponents helps your team a lot because even if you can't finish someone off on your own your team is there to help you and if one of your teammates go down you can defib someone and keep them alive speaking of staying alive make sure you're using your movement and gadgets to outplay your opponents this is especially useful when fighting in buildings cuz the enemies never expect a window jump when I'm being chased utilize your gadgets use Goo or grenades or flashbangs whatever you need to help stay alive this kind of goes for every class but let's say you aren't running the right gadgets or you ran out well using the canisters around the map is extremely underrated I've gotten out of so many situations where I should have died but a trusty goo canister or red canister was there to save my life when I should have very easily died for all you AR users make sure you learn The Recoil pattern of your gun with that said I don't even fully know the recoil pattern of every gun I have the memory of a goldfish but I do remember the F car pattern because all the bullets do is go up to the right slightly this one was very easy to learn for me and with the season 4 update allowing me to remove the scope the F car has become a lot more satisfying to use so before jumping into a game check out the patterns in the practice range or do what I do and just shoot a wall when you join a game for a quick reminder of The Recoil pattern remember that Medium is a support class so if you're the type of player that likes defending cash outs then don't be sleeping on the mines sometimes you can get away with some pretty ridiculous things a man uh on that the will have to oh my God oh my oh my no [ __ ] way dude that's wild that is insane the glitch mine is still very powerful despite its season 4 Nerf you only get one but you can place two on the map once it's done charging up throwing a glitch mine on a statue is a great counter to other mediums and it's one of the most frustrating things they can encounter going for a defib on your teammate and being glitched and switched to your primary weapon is not a good time team coordination is huge in this game and I I get it solo cubing is tough but try to find someone you played well with and AD them having your team all push someone is easily one of the best ways to win and having coordination and trying out different things may surprise not just your team but you as well you're going to jump head up break through the window and place two turrets all right okay here hold on hold on wa wait so I'm going to place this jump Pad Place the turrets then we're going to go around over that side and you're going to jump P okay yeah yeah all right okay let's go turret jump drop all right now come back there I a jump pad right here moving follow go flank oh my God please oh my God oh my God what the [ __ ] dude so there you have it that's how you use medium get creative use your movement and support skills to your advantage keep your team alive and have some fun if you enjoyed the video consider leaving a like And subscribe for more finals content also leave a comment below if you found some tips and tricks you want to share

The Finals medium class,lMVVGDcec4A,I Spent 10 HOURS Playing Medium Build in the Finals to PROVE That the AKM Is Better Than the FCAR!,"You know what? I'll say it. The AKM is just simply better than the FCAR what? nah man you better take that back. Allow me to explain. Medium build in the finals is the class you want to be using If you have a desire to simply run it down with medium, you could choose from melee weapons, explosive weapons, and bullet weapons that are all unique in their own way. My goal for this video is quite simple. I'm going to play ten hours of medium build and objectively decide with gameplay stats whether the fcar or the AKM is better. Trust me when I tell you that this video gets wild as we face some tough teams. Try to get the highest ranked possible in world tour and got some end results that were surprisingly close. Going into hour one, I wanted to start off with a literal bang. I decided to use the model 1887 **Lever Action** shotgun. It's a brutally strong weapon that is counterbalanced with a small amount of ammo per clip and a painfully long reload animation, so you have to make every shot count. Let me break something down real quick, though. Cash out in season three is a little different in World Tour. Every single player starts off from the very lowest rank of bronze four with a maximum rank of gold one. There is no longer any way to de rank, and your progress will always track this season, so long as you're playing and winning tournaments. So now that I've explained that the goal for our one is super simple, I'm going to try to get through as much of bronze as possible with the model 1887. And oh man, did this shotgun pack a serious punch. Oh Scottie, I just love matches on Seoul so many different ways to play. Let's fucking go!  Wow, June, that was quite a way to start, right? Oh, absolutely. Scotty, let's see what hour two brings. The katanas are incredibly cool, but kind of mid in terms of strength. So for that reason you don't see too many people using them in game. Which is kind of a shame being able to deflect and get satisfying three slice kills makes them very fun to use at times. Despite all this, I have two main problems with them. First, they're short range, so I have to find creative ways to close the gap on my opponent's second. I can't deflect every type of incoming damage. And the sheer amount of flamethrower players that we were going against was absurd and so frustrating. So it's true. We had a tough time in the beginning half of this hour, but I was not about to give up. My new strategy was going to be to try and use a full mobility kit with both jump pad and zipline, to constantly be able to get to and from my opponents. Let's see how that worked. Never mind Maria. has a skin, I'm the only one that looks like a jackass. Oh bow guy on me bow guy on me half health I can deflect him. He ain't gonna do shit Oh yeah Deflect his ass Oh, no. i’m stuck! Shit Wait. I can get him hold on Maybe. Oh, he's too fast. Yo stop running Down here. Down here. Get em’ Yo, I'm missing. He’s just too nimble Oh. Right in here Max. I’m on my way... Yeah. Yes I definitely could have used my zipline a little better there, but you get the idea. Needless to say, round one of this match went incredibly smooth. Minus some difficulty rezzing my teammates Here Maria. Catch this. catch Max’s body. Rez that You didn't even throw it to me. Sorry. It's too slow with the low grav Round two of this match was not friendly and with the finals on the line, we were crazy to be pushing it to the wire. Our first hope was to try and just third party. Another team. Oh I’m so down to third party. The shit. Oh my God, oh my god, oh my God. Oh! Nahh it's not enough time. my God bro... it's not enough time. Uh oh... Now we really gotta a clutch. Okay, we have one more chance. I'm in here. I'm in here. got one red is in here. he's like one in here. I need you guys to drop in there quick. Yes, yes, yes, Yesssssss Purple! I'm literally stuck alright We're fine. We got it we’re chillin’ Niceeee Bro why is YouTube recommending me brain surgery. Like, actual brain surgery. Like I could see the fucking brain. Being in the finals always brings some sort of challenge in this time was no exception. The heavy on the other team was using the MGL 32 grenade launcher, and it was super irritating to go against. At least I was able to get some use out of my deflect ability though, I just deflect killed em’ right here. Outside front front front front. Oh he's freaking oh his boyfriend’s here he's one. I'm inside right now. That guy’s stuck That guy got stuck! One more, one more. Right up here. Above me, above me. yo I'm stuck. Holy fuck bruh. Oh who stinkied? I farted I farted my bad They’re above you guys on my floor. Oh, Jesus. He's going to kill me immediately. I'm stunned. I’m stunned I guess I'll just token. But we're we're going to be hold on. I'm going to try and sneak back in and rez her if I can. Nice. Okay. aw fuck congrats. Your boyfriend died. He's rising right now. Nice... Okay I could token I could token I did it already I called it that was, alright well, we're not getting this one. Take the zip with me right there. You just saw him go inside. go into the roof right now. Oh, the fuck. Okay. Alright we have control Nice! Their Tank is just going to break holes in everything right here on me. Right here. Fuck In the roof! I’m healing You He's one Thank you. Good heals. Yo he’s throwing... Bro I hate that. Just get out of the we know this guy’s a loser so... Umm yea This is an awkward spot. Yo one HP on the light I'm healing. I'm trying to heal you 1 HP I have no range. I have no range. I can't do any- Just die I guess Should I? I’m up in four But I feel you’re just going to die right now. Use the token Fuck. Good try, good try. Oh, wait. We're done already? It’s just to 20K? That's it. Just to 20K! Alright For hour three, I wanted to continue using melee weapons, so I pulled out the only other melee weapon in medium class, the riot shield. This weapon is versatile and like the katanas, requires a way of closing gaps between other players. Since this was the weapon I was least familiar with, I took to the internet to make sure I wasn't missing any details. Usually I run a pretty typical class setup for medium build with healing beam and defib but based on my research, I decided to use the Guardian Cert and APS turret to allow me and my teammates to lock down cashouts a little more effectively. And what do you know? There were more flamethrower players, which I can't do anything about with the riot shield. Alright so I'm not running heal-beam and I'm not running, uhhh defib this match. So, uhhh that’s fine a lot more utility You got zip line, jump pad and APS turret So no grenades and shit If we hold something down, you know, meteor showers bring May flowers Pink. Pink. Pink. Pink. Oh, boy. He might try to break this down. Be careful. Oh my God, red is coming around the back. Oh my God. Oh that’s not good Someone still here shooting me Franco’s on one. Franco's on one. Yeah just help Franco... Just help Franco! Just help Franco! Yeah He’s one health already Aw man Holy cuck Gotta play this like Assassin's Creed now We gotta get to cashout quick. Otherwise... Red is gonna start A They're going to start A So just let them start it and go to A Oh they're getting interrupted I'm landing straight on the people interrupting them. Fucking pink is holding it hostage. Ohhhh Oh my God he's really low! He's low right there! Yeah, yeah! The tank should be half I can’t with this. Fuck- They're they're gonna to prevent the cashout Pink had completely shut us down this game and we just had no answers for it. So we placed dead last. I don't think the turret really helped I'm going to go back to Healing Beam. That's just so much more useful. The APS turret lowkey though. That helped. I thought game two was going to be a lot better, but we still had a lot of difficulty stealing cash outs from other teams. I'm try- on me still... Bro how am I missing this shit? Nice! Got his ass okay Oh my god, I'm missing everything. I'm trash You're good I got you, I got you just stall just stall Max. Oh my God I’m so shit One more shot. Awwwwhh Oh no ohhhhh that was good try good God dammit I missed My aim is so poop bro Good try, good try I'm trying to get back up to the roof now. Oh my God, get this idiot out of my face. It's doubled right now. Go for it. Just go for it. Fuck my body Go for it. Oh my God, bro! Holy shit. Ha ha ha what the fuck? Maybe we have a slight chance. Go steal! Steal steal steal steal steal! Max Max Max! Max! Steal it! Me? Yes! Okay :) Shit I’m retarded So unfortunately we lost a lot during hour three. For whatever reason. It just felt like no matter which cashout we tried to steal, there was always some sort of third party to go along with it. Overall, the riot shield is definitely a weapon that takes a lot of time and understanding to fully master, and I don't think giving it just one hour of time would be enough to let that flourish in my gameplay, but that's all the melee weapons in medium class, and thank goodness I'm done with those. Now let's move on to a weapon that's been a staple in this game since day one. The competition starts right here. This is the first hour of two where I'm going to be using the AKM. This weapon, in my personal opinion, is an absolute beast. It's mainly due to the fact that you get a generous 36 rounds per clip, and some pretty easy recoil control patterns. By steadying your mouse and pulling down, you actually have a really easy time honing in the recoil spread of this weapon Oh It's the worst shit ever It's the moving floating platforms. Alright it's over. He’s cheeks. Oh, good Headshot. Fuck. NT, NT Nice shots! On our right! on the roof with us! One guy, one guy, one guy! One... One is charging. He's charging the heavy on you! He went up. Yep. He's up. He's in the room now. Yo, they're just running around dead That should be game everybody. Nice job. Holy crap. Yeah, we probably got close to 70 kills total. That's insane. And this everybody is why I like the AKM. It's just fucking. It's just better. I don't know what to say. We got a total of 70 eliminations as a team in one match, and I racked up 22 of those myself. Starting the AKM off pretty strong. Oh, and I almost forgot to mention this shit happened during our match too. It was insane. That entire tow- yo you guys see that tower? What the. Oh, what the fuck? whaaaatttt? That shit got chopped up like a tree bruh I've never seen that. Betchu’ you thought I was going to jump straight into using the Fcar. Not quite. Since I'm gonna be using every single weapon in medium class for this video, I thought I would take a little detour and pull out the R 357 revolver. It's a weapon that hits hard most of the time, but I have come to find that it has some quirks when it comes to hit detection. I don't know what the deal is with most of the semi-automatic weapons in the finals, but I feel like the crosshairs lie to me sometimes. Despite that, getting clips with this little monster is actually a ton of fun, and I let it show June... Uh... Question... WOW! Fennek Successfully denies the Mighty from a cashout steal. At this point, five hours in, we were sitting pretty comfortably in silver. Ranking up in World tour takes a lot longer than I thought it would, though. How would the rival to the AKM stack up during it’s first hour? Just as a reminder, I secured 22 eliminations with the AKM during it’s first hour, the Fcar behaves very similarly to the AKM, with the main differences being that it deals more damage, has a red dot site that you have to use, and has a lot less ammo per clip compared to the AKM. The Fcar’s recoil spread is pretty similar to the AKM, with a little bit more of a right horizontal trail in combination with it’s vertical trail. So uhhh... Anyways, I started blasting. We can stagger this guy. I got em’ I got em’ I got em’ Got one! One more on the platform one more, one more! He’s right by- Right there! Right there! Ohhhh Aaron you gotta get up there Nooooo He dropped off! he dropped off He’s right there you saw him! kill em’ and they’re wiped Yeah. Go go go go go. Get on the platform. No! Hurry! Hurry!!! Noooooo! Yeaaaaahhh Steal it! Go! right away!! Yes! Come on. Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah! *Nut* What?! Dude that's so tragic. I was so perfect on that, too. Oh! They rez Back here. One dea- Kill this guy! Don't let em’ get away. Got one light. One light dead Underneath! One’s underneath! Nice. One’s underneath! Two lights dead one more Just the medium and we win just the medium, we win GG Yeaaaaaaa Yeaeaeeaeaeaea look at us! One of them had zero kills. Yeah... Yeee... he had a bad game Yesssssss During this first hour with the Fcar. I ended up securing 24 elims Dang... So the Fcar is in the lead. Let's see if this holds up. For hour seven, I'm using the Famas Assault Rifle which is the only three round burst weapon in the medium class. The Famas has 27 bullets per clip, which is only two more than the Fcar. It does, however, do more damage in the AKM and about the same amount of damage as the Fcar. Despite the high damage capability, it’s main drawbacks come in the form of a decreased fire rate and an upward zigzagging recoil pattern, which makes it harder to get that damage off. Overall, though, I would call it a close third out of all the medium weapons. Anyway, we made quick work of the first two rounds of a match on Monaco, catapulting ourselves straight into the finals against the shock and awe This is where things got more interesting, for sure. Uhhhh they have a leaver to start. Somebody disconnected. Brother maybe he’ll rejoin No he will but... No he won’t But for the first box, he's gone. So let's make advantage of it. Yeah? Oh, they're back, they’re back Oh, no. Well, we got to- We got like a 15 second head start. That could be a big difference in the game overall. Huge difference bro. They're trying to knock it down right now. Be careful. They're about to knock the shit down. Yeah yeah I see that. Wow we threw we threw Ohhhhh No way! no way! He- Dude he hooked me from inside. Come on. One more, one more, one more! He's on the roof. Okay. Oh, he's down here. Defib! Defib! Defib! One more, one more! light. It's a light going around the corner. Got em’ Oh I was gonna winch him too What are we doing? We're throwing we’re- we’re literally throwing. Come on. Going to B okay. They're they're trying to knock it right now. They're knocked it. Yo get ready behind us Maria They're all by Maria. Aaron. He's rezzing He's rezzing He’s grabbing the body. He's grabbing the body to rez He's coming for you Dude This fucking guy hits me so hard!! So annoying. Noooooo Broooo Nice. They wiped, they wipe, they wipe... They did? Oh my God get a rez, get a rez, get a rez! Yeah we're good. What the hell? *Phew* We had to sweat to tie this match up. Now all we had to do was take one more cashout Unfortunately, though, we wiped and gave them the choice on where to start the final cashout Not good. They got me Reloading, reloading They got me, That light was one... That guy just hits so hard There’s no way, there’s no way... Shit Hits so hard Shoot shoot shoot! I'm fucked... I'm so fucked I'm so fucked... GG We lost. We got absolutely pummeled by their heavy. Who was using the  KS- 23 shotgun Oh well... you can't win em’ all as they say. Alright ladies and gentlemen it's time to find out whether the AKM or the Fcar is the true king of medium class. We'll make this as simple as possible. Whatever gun gets more eliminations right now, in addition to the previous amount earlier in this video is the winner. Let's see who comes out on top. Looks like we have a winner. With a score of 63 eliminations, the AKM reigns as king of medium class. Got to give it to the Fcar, though it came pretty close with 54 elims When it comes to our ranks, we basically capped out at silver 2 for the entire ten hours of recording, and I was ranked at number 12,291 overall, which is really solid for that given time period. Now, there's one more weapon I'd like to treat you all to. Just gonna be absolutely, brutally honest. The CL-40 grenade launcher absolutely blows. Everyone knows it Even Embark knows it. This gun doesn't even have any cool skins. It takes like 3 to 4 shots, which is the whole clip to successfully eliminate an opponent and gets completely shut down by a single APS turret. Maybe this part of the video can convince Embark to do it some justice, cuz’ oh man. He's seriously going to use that thing for a montage? I guess so... Job ain’t finished yet...","The text doesn't provide any specific details or opinions about the pike .556 weapon for the game 'The Finals'. It mainly discusses the comparison between the FCAR and the AKM weapons, the medium build class, and the effectiveness of the model 1887 Lever Action shotgun and katanas. However, there is no mention or discussion about the Pike .556 weapon. The player seems to have mixed feelings about the pike .556. On the positive side, they find it fun to use and appreciate its short-range capabilities, suggesting that it offers a unique and challenging gameplay experience. They also mention using a full mobility kit with both jump pad and zipline, suggesting that mobility is key when using the pike .556.

The data and opinions presented show significant favor towards the pike .556 in the game 'The Finals'. With 2,291 overall, it is considered a solid weapon during the given time period. However, the same cannot be said for the CL-40 grenade launcher, which is overwhelmingly viewed negatively. Many players, including the commentator, feel that this weapon is extremely underpowered, requiring 3 to 4 shots just to eliminate a single opponent. Additionally, it is also easily countered by a single APS turret. The weapon's lack of cool skins is also brought up, indicating that its aesthetic appeal is also lacking. The commentator is of the opinion that the game's developers, Embark, should improve the CL-40 grenade launcher. Despite its current state, the commentator seems to have plans to use it in a future gameplay montage."

The Finals pike .556,nwWbiDvOLEA,The Pike-556 Absolutely DESTROYS Lobbies in Season 4 of The Finals,[Applause] especially since it still has trouble through multiple layers of walls so it's like it didn't even technically fix that it just feels worse overall okay I'm dead GG's I'm dead I think the shotgun might be the least op for lights but it's still like really really good it's like better than the double barrel for sure what better than the double barrel for [ __ ] sure oh oh oh wow in my op just dashed those double barrel is like still has some good uses and it's not bad by any means but I think consistently you would just pop off more with the hold up with the new shotgun anyway new map is also a huge W by the way oh you can steal from above like this like a head glitch so steal watch my right come up the stairs they might use my hole that's insane I'm so sorry bro bro brother there is just no way that was a cal like I know the moment you said it you realized it was just like

everything's breaking oh my God I couldn't I'm so sad no got ITA I actually could have easily stopped that oh my got a mine that's not very CH them I think this cash out mode is just to compensate for the fact that uh oh boy but just to compensate for the fact that it's the test server I don't think this is how cash out's going to be because if so that's it's not as good hands down hands down it's not as good but like when you compens like when you think about the fact that getting making 12 player lobbies or not 12 nine player lobbies is easier than 12 it makes sense oh my God I Whi so much oh oh there was there was a pad oh I didn't see the pad at all GG's I wouldn't have stuck there yeah I may have um I may have Ed like I just said lh1 did get a sight and it's very good I think the weapon is in a very good place now it also has some uh a lot of the inair accuracies it used to have especially like take a jump pad and [ __ ] and you're trying to shoot the midair it would be awful not they kind of removed that so it's in a much better place instead of touching the damage it feels like overall they kind of right something else which is makes me happy oh I didn't mean to do that at all no part of me wants to be I'm lagging so much I can't do anything I bro I'm at 20 yes I I can't do anything my mouse is going like [ __ ] Jesus Christ no I chose the worst Target behind you behind

they nerfed the dmat big sge please spread it around and I I really do mean this it's actually hard nerfed the I think the intention was there to buff it but the problem is it grabs a lot and when you

have less control than you did before it's like I I I get what the intention was and I think it does come from a good place they defin [ __ ] up really hard [Applause] bro my first won not going lie

The Finals Medium Meta,J4hY5VI-IN0,Medium Builds and Strategies - The Finals Guides / How to Guides Season 3,medium being the in between pick doesn't have the more apparent advantages that come with having the largest Health pool like heavy or highest damage output like light stat-wise it's middle of the ground in every way average Mobility average Health average damage so it makes sense for someone that knows nothing about the game to dismiss Medium as a class or contestant that has no advantages to offer and rather choose between the high health and high defensive capabilities of heavy or the high damage and high mobility of light depending on their preferred play style just looking at basic numbers medium might appear to be a class that serves no purpose but anyone that's actually played the finals knows that's not true what separates each class more than just the numbers are their specializations and gadgets and when throwing these into the mix the class's identities become much more distinct as of season 3 medium has three specializations that in my mind create three distinctively different play styles to choose from there's a supportive SL healer option a defensive SL lockdown option and what I'd call a more Mobility SL damage focused option all of which I think are viable ways to play if they're paired with the right gadgets my three strategies may not Encompass all possible play Styles but it's what comes to mind when I see each specialization you you may have your own strategies that differ from mine the builds and strategies I'll be going over are made considering cash out as a primary game mode but two of these builds can also work in terminal attack my preferred play style and the one I'd like to highlight first is the supportive option this play style involves using the healing beam as your specialization along with at least two supportive gadgets we'll consider the third Gadget slot to be a flexible slot that can vary from round to round and this will be true for all of our builds the gadgets you'd want for this play style are ones that support your team in some way the no-brainer choice is the defib and to be honest I think the defib is such a great Gadget that it's hard not to put in every medium build and the second supportive Gadget is the jump pad it's a quick to place Gadget that anyone on your team can use and it comes in handy for the support strategy that I'll explain in a bit an alternative to the jump pad is of course the zip line which serves a similar purpose a preference for the jump pad over the zip line simply comes from the fact that the jump pad is faster to place and you don't move in a forced slow and predictable path like you would with the zip line although there are places that can be too high or too far away to reach with the jump pad making the zip line necessary at times for my Flex Gadget I usually default a frag grenade cuz I like to have throwables but depending on the situation glitch traps are a great choice I'd use glitch traps in situations where I'm playing against a lot of lights with cloaking device or evasive Dash or even against other mediums that are using healing beam and defib since those are the players that rely the most on having their specialization at the ready and one good trap can ruin their day other than that this is the one slot that can be used for whatever you'd like the strategy for the support play style is that you want to be more of a follower going along with your team wherever they'd like to go and keeping a close eye on them without physically being too close to them ideally if your group is dying you want to be the the last one down because you should be the one keeping them up it can be a bit tricky switching back and forth from playing this way and playing as if you don't have the heal beam since you have to remind yourself that your team should be doing most of the heavy lifting in the damage compartment and you should be behind them they're off to the side keeping them alive as you're following it's best to prioritize shooting at the same targets as your team and centure behind them this should mean you'll generally be taking less damage in fights and you'll be able to see your team's Health to know when a fight is going south and you need to switch to your healing beam the most important thing to note about playing with the healing beam as your specialization is that if you're healing someone there's no need need for you to be out in the open as well while they're taking damage if there's an opportunity to sit behind some form of cover while you're healing then do it there's no value in standing somewhere where you can get shot and you can't fight back knowing when to switch off of your weapon to your healing beam and taking a back seat is the key to making this play style work it comes from deciding in the moment whether it would be more beneficial to heal in a given situation or if it would be more beneficial to damage now as far as why the gadgets I mentioned work well at this play style is that the defib obviously can revive people making it ideal for a Healer and support Focus strategy and I don't think it needs much more EXP than that as far as the jump pad or zip line other than being a gadget that everyone on your team can use it's also just a great repositioning tool for you when as I described earlier you're healing and don't want to be standing out in the open it can help you reposition to a distance that still works with the healing beam while also giving you a good vantage point to help in fights from a distance which brings us to our ideal weapon choices if you're playing from a distance doesn't make sense to use weapons that don't have any range so weapons like the riot shield or dual blades just aren't a good fit for this play style but I won't say there's any Perfect Weapon choice so just choose what you like what makes this my preferred play style for medium is that it's only possible to play this way on medium medium is the only contestant in the game that can heal their team and's the only one that can perform an instant revive maybe others will be able to do this stuff in the future but we'll have to wait and see whereas you can argue that the other strategies that I'll be describing can be mimicked to an extent by the other two classes now onto my second play style the defensive or lock down option involves picking the guardian turret of course and defending the objective whether you're playing cash out or terminal attack it's much easier to set this up in terminal Tech during the defense pre-round phase but other than it being more difficult in cash out or on the offensive side of terminal attack to set up the play style remains pretty much unchanged the gadgets you'd want to use are gadgets that are ideal for locking down an objective most importantly gas mines gas mines are what I'd say are the best of the mines to use for this lock down play style and I'll go into more detail as to why when discussing the overall strategy our second Gadget will also be mines but this time it's a choice between explosive mines or glitch trps between the two I usually gravitate towards explosive mines because I prefer the extra damage over the ability denial and combined with the turret and gas mines you can end up getting eims sometimes without even having to do anything as I said for the build the third slot is your choice but as I also said it's hard for me not to choose the defib since there's no other alternative to what it can do that being said there are some other good choices here such as the aps turret to help protect your setup or the other set of Mines that you didn't choose for your second slot now the strategy that I find most effective for locking down an objective is placing your gas mines on the objective itself just in case it ends up shifting around or being dropped to another floor the gas not only provides more area denial for a lockdown build but also denies your opponents from taking the objective even if your team gets wiped if your opponents don't have a way to counter the gas this could be potentially waste five or more seconds of their time depending on when each mine gets triggered also take into consideration that it takes about 5 seconds for a Cash Out Steel to finish and you're adding extra waste of time on top of that with these gas mines to make matters worse for your opponent the added annoyance from the guardian turret and another set of Mines can make stealing an objective feel hopeless for explosive mind placements I found the best spots are right after someone turns a corner since this game can be really fast-paced especially when you're playing right on an objective most people aren't going to be taking the time to clear Corners before running in and I find more success placing them this way than at entry points like I more commonly see them placed with glitch shaps you should be more concerned about placing them in spots to cover as much area as possible and keep in mind that you don't have to place them in spots that people tend to walk in order to activate them with how they work now as far as turret placement goes priority number one is that it needs to be in a spot that covers as much of the room as possible and priority number two is that you want it in a spot where it's hard to get a good angle to destroy it a good placement is a balance between the two protecting an indoor objective is easier but this strategy can work with an outdoor objective as well just not as great turret has pretty great range and if you're placing gas mines on the actual objective as I described this can be enough to keep it locked down it's a lot trickier to place your other set of mins but it's better to place them than to not as far as weapon choices the only one that I might stay away from is the cl40 just to not accidentally blow up any Minds I normally stick to ARS on medium but in theory the riot shield can work really well with this play style the only downside being when you don't have an objective you're locking down you're now stuck with a weapon that has no range a good alternative would be the model 1887 which has a surprising amount of range but it's still most effective from short to medium distances My overall opinion on this play style is that while it's great I tend to be too impatient at times to want to sit in the room with the objective waiting for people to push in so if you have a similar problem maybe try one of the other two play Styles instead okay now this last play style I haven't quite refined but I'd like to at least paint a picture of how it should work if played right it can be just as devastating as the other builds but it also has what I believe to be the biggest gap between skill floor and ceiling you'll be using the dematerializer as your specialization basically creating a build that makes you have extremely high area damage this build can also act as a counter to the lock down play style or any other team that's playing highly defensively the first first Gadget is going to be the frag grenade or pyro grenade and these are essential for tying this Build Together second will be explosive mines or gas mines but if you're using pyro grenades steer clear of using gas mines with them and your third Gadget can be a mine or throwable as well the defib or anything else you'd like but more mines or throwables would technically better complete the build the strategy is that you should be popping in and out of fights using the dematerializer to accomplish this and get a surprise angle or a quick escape on your opponents as you open your window with a dematerializer or find an existing opening for your surprise angle you'll have the opportunity to use a frag or pyro followed by your mind the frags with explosive minds work best for this strategy cuz if executed perfectly you can instantly delete someone or get them extremely low the frag will act as a Detonator for your mind rather than relying on the inconsistency of it getting tripped naturally you can also use the pyrro grenade as an alternative to the frag as a Detonator although it's a bit slower it's important to do this in the exact order I mentioned because the throwables take longer to throw than a mine takes the place saving you time and making it more difficult to get out of when doing it this way this is hard to pull off because you generally only get one opportunity to catch someone by surprise during a fight and swapping between your specialization two gadgets and then back to your weapon is a lot of inputs in a short time then of course if they move too much either only one or nothing will hit which is why this is great when playing against defensive teams chances are they'll have something placed down that can cause a chain reaction if you miss with your throwable while this can technically be done with any specialization being able to create an opening of your own means you can do this with more success than running into an existing opening and trying to toss a frag in mine at someone and since medium doesn't have any real ways to destroy walls other than the dematerializer at the moment it makes it the best choice if you're pulling off a quick escape the same thing can be done if your opponent tries to chase it catches people almost every time of course your priority should be to try and cut them off by closing a wall you've opened so they can't chase in the first place but if they do make it through you'll be ready tossing a throwable at your feet and then placing a mine shortly after Works nearly every time one of them will almost always hit this is way more consistent than the surprise angle it makes this build the best for personal survivability this build is centered around trying to wipe out a Target without giving them much of an opportunity to fight back which sounds great on paper but it is extremely difficult to pull off consistently I'm sure with enough practice ice though someone is going to get great at this if you prefer area denial over the high damage frag explosive mine combo then gas mines work better or pyrro grenades with explosive mines weapons of choice for this build are similar to The lockdown build anything works but unlike the lockdown build you want to blow up your mines so if the cl40 ever ends up getting a buff it would be absolutely deadly with this build the skill cing for this build is extremely high since a dematerializer is a very quick thinking specialization that requires a bit of creativity and you have to look at the maps and walls in a completely different way plus as I mentioned earlier swapping between your specialization two gadgets and your weapon it's a lot to do in a short time span I haven't used this build enough to claim I'm good at it but I know it can work better than I'm showcasing in this video to me medium specializes in filling in the gaps your team has whether that's a lack of Defense a lack of offense or a lack of support to tie your team together cuz more important than your own build Synergy is how well you're playing with your team despite medium's lack of High stats and health or damage you can make up for it with how you choose to play different players will gravitate towards a different one of these builds and because medium offers a taste of the other two classes with the defensive lockdown build and the ability damage build plus it has its own completely unique play style medium in my opinion is the best starter pick for anyone new trying to get into the game thanks for watching,"The given text provides a detailed analysis of the medium class in the game 'The Finals', which uses the Pike .556. It seems that the player initially perceives the medium class as a 'jack of all trades, master of none' type of class, due to its average mobility, health, and damage. However, it's noted that the medium class has a certain appeal for those who have actually played the game, primarily due to its unique specializations and gadgets.

As of season 3, there are three specializations offered for the medium class: a supportive SL healer option, a defensive SL lockdown option, and a mobility SL damage-focused option. These specializations allow for distinct play styles, which, when paired with the right gadgets, become viable strategies.

The player's preferred play style is the supportive option, which involves using the healing beam specialization along with at least two supportive gadgets. The third gadget slot is flexible and can vary from round to round.

As for the Pike .556, the player doesn't provide any specific comments or opinions. As an assistant analyzing weapon data, it's important to note that the weapon's effectiveness may vary depending on the player's chosen specialization and play style. The user has not offered any specific opinions about the pike .556 weapon from the game 'The Finals'. Instead, they have detailed their strategy for playing a medium class character, focusing on supportive gadgets such as the defib and the jump pad. They also mention alternatives like the zip line and glitch traps, indicating that these choices depend on the situation and the opponents' strategies. They suggest that the medium class should play more of a support role, sticking close to the team and keeping them alive rather than leading the fight. The strategy they describe doesn't directly involve the pike .556, so any insights about this weapon's balancing or overall use are not present in this text. The text provided does not contain specific details about the weapon balancing or overall opinions on the pike .556 for the game 'The Finals'. Please provide the relevant details for further analysis. The text appears to be detailing a defensive playstyle strategy rather than specific opinions on the Pike .556 weapon in 'The Finals'. It discusses the use of the Guardian Turret, Gas Mines, Explosive Mines, and Glitch Trps as part of a lockdown strategy. The Defib is also mentioned as a valuable tool for its unique revive capability. However, there are no mentions or opinions about the Pike .556 weapon in the provided text. Therefore, no detailed opinions about weapon balancing or overall opinions on the Pike .556 can be extracted from the provided information. The user's opinion does not directly address the Pike .556 weapon in the game 'The Finals'. The comment mainly discusses strategies related to placing and triggering gas mines and turret placements, with a brief mention of avoiding the cl40 weapon. The user also talks about sticking to ARS on medium and the potential of using the riot shield. For detailed opinions on the Pike .556, you may need to look elsewhere. The user doesn't specifically mention the 'Pike .556' weapon in their review. Therefore, no specific opinions or feedback on the Pike .556 can be extracted from this text. The player's opinion seems to be somewhat mixed regarding the pike .556 weapon and its associated tactics in 'The Finals'. They suggest that the use of pyrro grenade as an alternative to the frag can work as a Detonator, although it's slower. The strategy of swapping between specialization, two gadgets, and then back to the weapon, could be challenging due to the quick input required and the risk of missing the target, especially if they move too much. 

The player also suggests that the strategy is particularly effective against defensive teams, who are likely to have placed down items that could cause a chain reaction. However, they note that the success of this strategy is more reliant on creating an opening rather than trying to take advantage of an existing one. 

In terms of medium class's ability to destroy walls, the only option currently available is the dematerializer, making it the best choice for a quick escape. The player suggests that this strategy is more consistent than the surprise angle and enhances personal survivability. 

However, they also note that while the build aiming to eliminate a target without giving them much opportunity to fight back sounds great on paper, it is very challenging to execute consistently. They conclude by suggesting that with enough practice, someone might get proficient with this style of play. The player did not provide a clear opinion on the overall weapon balance in the game. The player expresses a high degree of complexity and skill ceiling in using the pike .556 in 'The Finals'. They suggest that the pike .556, when paired with explosive mines and frag explosives or gas mines and pyrro grenades, can be highly effective. However, the ability to utilize this combination effectively requires quick thinking, creativity, and a deep understanding of the game's maps. 

They also mention that the pike .556 could potentially become even more lethal if the cl40 receives a buff. Despite the high skill requirement and the need for quick swapping between gadgets and weapons, the player believes that this build can work well if used properly.

Moreover, the player thinks that the medium class, in which the pike .556 belongs, is a versatile option that can fill various roles depending on the team's needs, be it defense, offense, or support. This adaptability makes the medium class, in their opinion, the ideal choice for beginners.

The overall opinion of the pike .556 and the medium class seems positive, but it is also implied that mastering them requires a good amount of practice and understanding of the game's mechanics."
The Finals Medium Meta,81CpaQSUMG8,How to Win More with Medium Class – The Finals Pro Tips,medium is the most used Class in the finals right now I think and after close to 650 hours in the game I want to share the things I've learned Ming medium and high level lobbies but before you jump in the arena make sure you know what you're up against one of the things I like to do is check the leaderboard before getting into the game this way I know which classes I'm up against and I can choose my counter weapons and gadgets if I see a lot of lights in my Lobby for example I'll choose between the F card the revolver or the model 1887 because I counter best lights with those weapons one of the most interesting things I found about this game is how Embark managed to make the medium a support class while also acting as an assault class you can do just as much damage if not more than a heavy or light while still supporting your team more than they can this brings me to the heal beam I've seen a lot less medium players use the heal beam after their season 4 Nerf but it's still an extremely powerful tool for the medium class I'm sure we've all been against a three medium heal beam circle jerk before I'm back circle jerk circle jerk circle jerk circle jerk circle jerk but remember you don't always have to be aggressive as medium you can hang back with the heal beam and watch the show I'm healing you bro I'm healing you bro I'm healing you bro it's all you bro nice another thing you can do with the heal beam is the body block heal Strat that I'm sure you've all encountered before which is also really good for the last second steals but hey if you're not a heal beam guy that's okay with me you have to find the best specializations and gadgets that fit your play style I personally like to stay alive as long as I can so I've been using a lot of things to keep me alive like the goo grenade and dematerializer as of recent Staying Alive while dealing damage to your opponents helps your team a lot because even if you can't finish someone off on your own your team is there to help you and if one of your teammates go down you can defib someone and keep them alive speaking of staying alive make sure you're using your movement and gadgets to outplay your opponents this is especially useful when fighting in buildings cuz the enemies never expect a window jump when I'm being chased utilize your gadgets use Goo or grenades or flashbangs whatever you need to help stay alive this kind of goes for every class but let's say you aren't running the right gadgets or you ran out well using the canisters around the map is extremely underrated I've gotten out of so many situations where I should have died but a trusty goo canister or red canister was there to save my life when I should have very easily died for all you AR users make sure you learn The Recoil pattern of your gun with that said I don't even fully know the recoil pattern of every gun I have the memory of a goldfish but I do remember the F car pattern because all the bullets do is go up to the right slightly this one was very easy to learn for me and with the season 4 update allowing me to remove the scope the F car has become a lot more satisfying to use so before jumping into a game check out the patterns in the practice range or do what I do and just shoot a wall when you join a game for a quick reminder of The Recoil pattern remember that Medium is a support class so if you're the type of player that likes defending cash outs then don't be sleeping on the mines sometimes you can get away with some pretty ridiculous things a man uh on that the will have to oh my God oh my oh my no [ __ ] way dude that's wild that is insane the glitch mine is still very powerful despite its season 4 Nerf you only get one but you can place two on the map once it's done charging up throwing a glitch mine on a statue is a great counter to other mediums and it's one of the most frustrating things they can encounter going for a defib on your teammate and being glitched and switched to your primary weapon is not a good time team coordination is huge in this game and I I get it solo cubing is tough but try to find someone you played well with and AD them having your team all push someone is easily one of the best ways to win and having coordination and trying out different things may surprise not just your team but you as well you're going to jump head up break through the window and place two turrets all right okay here hold on hold on wa wait so I'm going to place this jump Pad Place the turrets then we're going to go around over that side and you're going to jump P okay yeah yeah all right okay let's go turret jump drop all right now come back there I a jump pad right here moving follow go flank oh my God please oh my God oh my God what the [ __ ] dude so there you have it that's how you use medium get creative use your movement and support skills to your advantage keep your team alive and have some fun if you enjoyed the video consider leaving a like And subscribe for more finals content also leave a comment below if you found some tips and tricks you want to share while using the medium class that's all I got for today thanks for watching and I'll see you next time,"The player expresses a lot of interest and investment in 'The Finals' game, having played around 650 hours. They appreciate the versatility of the medium class, which can function as both a support and an assault class. They believe it's capable of dealing the same, if not more, damage than a heavy or light class while being able to provide more support to the team.

The player has noticed a decline in the use of the heal beam tool for the medium class after the season 4 nerf but believes it remains a powerful tool. They suggest a passive playstyle, utilizing the heal beam from a distance rather than engaging aggressively in combat. They also mention a strategy involving the heal beam, called the body block heal strat, which they think is effective for last-minute steals.

However, they acknowledge that players may have different playstyles and suggest experimenting with different specializations and gadgets. They personally prefer using items like the goo grenade and dematerializer to help them survive longer in the game.

As for the pike .556, they didn't mention anything specific about this weapon. It's unclear what they think about its balancing or overall performance in the game. The commentary seems to be generally positive about the strategic elements of the game 'The Finals', especially when it comes to utilizing the medium class and its equipment like mines and gadgets. However, there is no specific mention of the weapon 'Pike .556'. The review does mention the importance of learning the recoil pattern of each weapon, and praises the season 4 update for allowing scope removal, which made using the F Car weapon more satisfying. The Glitch Mine also received positive feedback despite its season 4 Nerf. The player found it very powerful and a great counter to other mediums. Thus, the overall opinion seems to be that the medium class is balanced and offers strategic gameplay. The provided text does not contain any specific opinions or details about the weapon balancing or overall views on the Pike .556 for the game 'The Finals'. It mostly discusses team coordination and strategies for using the medium class, but no mention or evaluation of the Pike .556 is made."

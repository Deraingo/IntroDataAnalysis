"If 1887 gets nerfed, the Famas is next.","This community really needs to chill.  The nerf this and nerf that is an ever revolving cycle.  There are really only 3 viable medium guns that do exceptional damage to each class: the 1887, Pike, and Famas.  The AKM, FCAR, and CL40 all got nerfed and revolver might as well not exist.  Once the pike and 1887 get nerfed, the Famas will be the new target.  

Famas is my 3rd fav medium gun behind 1887 and CL40, so I've got some decent experience on it.  In hip fire, the accuracy is insane and does crazy burst damage.  Now, with the new scope, it shreds even more at range and getting easier headshots.  Famas is truly an all arounder.  Once people are shepered in to using it from the nerfs, they'll realize all of this.  Then, shortly thereafter, nerfs will be called for it.  

Good luck to Famas mains.  The days are numbered if Embark/the community continue down this path.",668,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1g8tjbh/if_1887_gets_nerfed_the_famas_is_next/,1729527167.0,0.1027,880

Revert cl40 rof nerf,When they buffed the CL to do big damage they also nerfed the rof because else it would've been even more op-er. But now it's back to doin little damage so why not give it that tiny beet rof again heh? Im sure the 2 cl40 users will appreciate it and it won't break the game I pinky promise embark. Also maybe buff the reload speed when fully empty cause gawd damn by the time I'm reloaded the tournament is already over.,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1ggomck/revert_cl40_rof_nerf/,1730407528.0,-0.6174,420

Genuinely how do you deal with dash + sword,"Ive tried everything, every permutation of every loadout it doesnt fucking stop a light with half a brain. Ran what I thought would be the hardest counter on medium: CL40, turret, glitch mine. It gives me some chance but other than on cashout defense, in every other fight I cant do shit against these shitheads. And thats just against one fucking light. Actually asking for advice/loadouts. If someone gives me a viable option all im gonna do is go into WT's and kill them specifically instead of doing objectives because istg this shit has been getting on my nerves for weeks.

Why doesn't my CL 40 do splash damage? ,"I thought that was the point of a grenade launcher.

Lets talk nerfs that can be reverted,"Wanted to see peoples thoughts on some nerf reversions from some of the items in the game that have seen excessive nerfs:
Heavies
-rpg- now that it only does 100 damage, can we get some better accuracy while in motion, and can we remove the double self damage?
-dome shield- now that it has really low health, can we have the original time for deployment?
-mesh shield- now that it can‚Äôt be cycled and heal beam has been nerfed, maybe a touch more health?
-c4- now that nukes are long dead and gone, maybe an up to the damage or map destruction? Maybe go back to 2 charges?
-winch claw- give back the 15m range and extra 10 damage?

Medium
-magnum-slightly less visual recoil?
-cl40- remove the double self damage?

Light
-sniper- maybe this is a comment towards other guns, but why does the only long range weapon have severe bullet drop when the mid range weapons like lh1 and pike don‚Äôt?
-breach charge- same as heavy c4. This item needs some love because thermal bore is just a ranged version of this
-thermal vision- remove the tablet?
-glitch grenade- slightly longer explosion time? Help it keep up to glitch mine

General
-gas- it used to do a lot more damage. Considering pyro is so common and deletes gas, maybe revert some of the damage. It kind of does a worse job then fire now and just gets removed by fire. 
-health regens-heavy could use some love in the health regen department now that heal beam is aligned. Thinking either a quicker regen delay, or a minimum amount of damage needed to stop the healing? One measly uzi round doesn‚Äôt have to stop that healing after such a long delay.

"The Model 1887 has a useless feature, tell me why it's even there","Why does this weapon have a feature that is useless without another mechanic. I'm specifically talking about the fact that if you hold m1, it fires, then doesn't lever the gun, when you press reload while holding it the gun will lever, then lever again to catch the shell that's still in the gun. The only reason that feature should be there is if you can eject the shell then immediately begin reloading, otherwise it shouldn't exist unless theres some unknown mechanic with it that I don't know about.",175,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1gz9uj7/the_model_1887_has_a_useless_feature_tell_me_why/,1732506220.0,-0.0495,503
"The ""proper"" way to balance 1887?","Buff other weapons, especially AR. Just... change the recoil.

1887 didn't get any big balance change since S1, which shows it was at its balance. The reason why its pick rate skyrocketed and there are ppl who says it is op, is because other weapons are not so good compared to 1887 rn. More accurately, there isn't special merit to choose AR or other weapons, compared to 1887.

Also, considering 1887 requires the most basic and hard skill, proper aiming, someone who uses it well can dominate the game anyway with other weapons.

Then, what should be done? Nerf 1887? No. Like I said, 1887 didn't get any nerf or buff before, meaning it doesn't have to be touched.

Instead, change other weapons better, especially reducing or fixing strange visual recoil system of ARs, especially akm. Personally I feel damage is enough, the stupid recoil is the main problem.

I'm not gonna talk about non-standard weapons like dual blades, cl40 or shield, ofc... Although I agree melee weapons for medium is misdesigned, I think someone with bad aim skill shouldn't get the chance to dominate the game easily. (Yeah I am talking about cl40 spammers existed at the start of s4)",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1g9hc97/the_proper_way_to_balance_1887/,1729601401.0,-0.9874,1166
How to get better ü•≤,"So I‚Äôve been playing The Finals since the end of s2. This is the first fps game I ever played. And my aim is sh** lol. I‚Äôve been playing heavy flamethrower for s3 and s4 because I don‚Äôt really need to aim and I‚Äôve been able to play some pretty decent matches.

However, I would very much want to be able to play something else. I practice a lot in powershift with different guns, but it seems like I‚Äôm just wasting my time (and frustrating some of my teammates sorry lol).

Do you guys have any tips or things to try to have a better aim and get better at the game? Thanks!! ",24,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1geylmg/how_to_get_better/,1730218808.0,0.9431,575

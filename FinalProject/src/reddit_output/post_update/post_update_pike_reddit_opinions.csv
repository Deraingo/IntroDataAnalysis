Pike 556 nerfed too much ,Anyone else feel like nerfing the dmg of the pike is too much? Going from a 3 shot to a 4 shot on lights has ruined the gun imo and I no longer find it viable.,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1gp286i/pike_556_nerfed_too_much/,1731356839.0,-0.6369,159

What are some of your unpopular opinions on The Finals?,"Iâ€™d say theyâ€™ve gotten lazy with the battle passes. Season one has the best one in terms of creativity. This seasonâ€™s battle items are bland and generic. The two pike skins are almost indistinguishable from the default. Also since Iâ€™m already here can we keep ranked and WT badges from previous seasons so we can equip them to our player card? Kinda like how apex letâ€™s you keep ranked badges, because I donâ€™t see the point in having the WT badges state the season itâ€™s from when at the end you canâ€™t keep it.",602,https://i.redd.it/595rarad390e1.jpeg,1731321386.0,0.3197,509
Why is pike scope so low-resolution?,I donâ€™t actually know if it is because the amout of the vram on my gpu is only 2gb. Does pike scope look clear to you?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1gxqf5v/why_is_pike_scope_so_lowresolution/,1732332768.0,0.3818,118
Since the pike antiquated the revolverâ€¦,"Iâ€™ve had no real reason or desire to pick up the revolver besides indulging in one of the coolest skins for a weapon ever (the blunderbuss pirate revolver).

Embark, please consider reworking the revolver by adding some fun value to it like a Fan-the-hammer function from Overwatch or some alternate fire like a coin shot from UltraKill, SOMETHING to make me remotely consider it over the pike!!

Please leave your suggestions below",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1gz7bne/since_the_pike_antiquated_the_revolver/,1732498233.0,0.8906,432

Pike rebalance idea,We all know the pike was broken in the finals when it first came out. But my god they really did it dirty with the nerfs. We all know damn well ain't nobody use the pike for it's long range. Anyway here's the rebalance. Buff the damage to where it was previously. Nerf the damage fall off or whatever to what it was before. Slower the fire rate so the ttk isnt as fast or something. Also remove visual recoil cause it fucking sucks. And maybe lower the mag size slightly. Now you got a good weapon that isn't shit and people don't complain about. I forgot from which YouTuber I got this opinion from btw but props to them for having good balance ideas.,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1h54iwo/pike_rebalance_idea/,1733170492.0,-0.9059,652
"I just watched this video because I knew the Pike was going to be shown, and the visual recoil is BAD, terrible, I don't understand why Embark can't just give us a static sight and no visual recoil...",,2,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvlt77TKVDg&ab_channel=swampfomp,1732486513.0,0.0,0

Revolver needs a buff,"There’s no reason to use the revolver when you could use something like the pike or either of the autos. It’s outclassed by literally every other semi auto in the game, LH1, KS-23, sniper, Pike all out play the revolver simply because they either hit harder, have more range, or are more accurate. I can’t count the amount of times I’ve been in a 1v1 against a light using LH1 and lose out simply because one bullet misses, therefore I propose a visual recoil reduction. 

It really doesn’t need any crazy changes because it’s a solid gun as is, and the 2x headshot multiplier is super strong. However, you can’t even consistently hit headshots because you have a seizure everytime you pull the trigger. I would like a bit of a range buff to contend with the pike a little better, but really all it needs is to be more comfortable to shoot. Hell, akimbo deagles feel more accurate at range when you’re technically hipfiring 2, 50 caliber monsters. If the revolver felt more like the way deagle shoots it would be a lot better of a weapon.

"I'm begging on my hands and knees, buff the revolver","There are so many reasons to buff the revolver

\- hard countered by all classes (shield, dodge, M1887)

\- M1887 and pike does everything better (pike has faster reload, more consistent damage, better falloff, more ammo. M1887 has bullet counted reload, same spread on ADS as with hipfire, can't headshot so it's easy to reach full damage output, and somehow better damage falloff than a revolver)

\- slow reload, slow fire rate, laughable damage falloff, and for some reason bloom even when ADSing.

\- was nerfed around 9 months ago and hasn't been touched since. even if the devs felt it was balanced then, there is no way it is anymore with all the changes the game has gone through.

  
I really think Embark should either:

1. Double the fire rate, and make it fully accurate with hipfire like the M1887 (the reasoning is that it shouldn't be a coin toss wether you manage to hit a light zipping around you with hipfire. If you miss a single shot, you will be shredded in the time it takes to cycle another round. If you are adamant about the revolver being bad at long range, then it needs to be good in other ranges.)

2. Remake it as a real western revolver with side-gate reloading, Spent rounds would be pushed out with the plunger and replaced one by one, so it can be fired as soon as a bullet is loaded, just like with the M1887. (This would eliminate one of the biggest frustrations with the revolver, not being able to finish off lights that have 3 health left)",172,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1gd4yri/im_begging_on_my_hands_and_knees_buff_the_revolver/,1730011263.0,-0.9175,1479

Unpopular opinion: You people are delusional about cosmetics (a bit of a rant),"The amount of posts complaining about the wheel and long battlepass is ridiculus. 

This is a free game, their monetization options are cosmetics or introducing pay to win. Personally I am used to games like world of tanks where for the first 8 years after the game came out, you get NOTHING in terms of cosmetics. Early fortnite, where you can grind the gigantic battlepass to get 3 weapon skins and spray or CS:GO, where they best thing you can get is some shitty skin with more scratches than paint or a case that you pay to open.

  
I do understand, that as a consumer the optimal choice is to forever scream that the price is too high, we don't get enough free stuff and we have to fight big corpo but jesus it is so annoying with what we get. I have never in my life seen a free to play, not P2W, game giving so much free stuff just for casual play. The fact that battlepas gives you enough bucks to earn another battlepass is already ridiculously generous from them. You get an event with 20 free items and you complain because you can't get them all for free??? You should be happy it's not battle pass only from the beggining.

I can kinda understand, that people are complaining about battle pass being too long, but it's also over exaggerated. Up to level 100 seems doable for casual players, the rest is supposed to be bonus anyway. From now on you can expect that the amount of time needed to complete it all is raising, if you're not ready for that just don't buy it next season (or check how long it takes on youtube first). It's all cosmetics, you don't actually need any of this stuff. If you are a completionist, then behave like one and put in the ridiculus hours.

TL;DR: Embark is giving a ridiculus amount of stuff for free, and people who complain about the wheel are spoiled",1005,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1gqarf2/unpopular_opinion_you_people_are_delusional_about/,1731497218.0,0.9899,1799
Revolver good pick now?,"So I’ve always been an assault rifle geek but after I got bored I tried revolver in the end of season 3. Then with season 4 Pyke has been my peek weapon to use but after nerfs that weapon feels inconsistent and outgunned by any other gun. 
So I switched to revolver cause auto rifles feel just like auto rifles and I wanted to challenge myself.

But revolver feels pretty good now, doesn’t it. Has there been any recent buffs to the weapon or cause of the Pyke nerfs it just feels better?",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1grfzyx/revolver_good_pick_now/,1731620268.0,0.1901,488

"If 1887 gets nerfed, the Famas is next.","This community really needs to chill.  The nerf this and nerf that is an ever revolving cycle.  There are really only 3 viable medium guns that do exceptional damage to each class: the 1887, Pike, and Famas.  The AKM, FCAR, and CL40 all got nerfed and revolver might as well not exist.  Once the pike and 1887 get nerfed, the Famas will be the new target.  

Famas is my 3rd fav medium gun behind 1887 and CL40, so I've got some decent experience on it.  In hip fire, the accuracy is insane and does crazy burst damage.  Now, with the new scope, it shreds even more at range and getting easier headshots.  Famas is truly an all arounder.  Once people are shepered in to using it from the nerfs, they'll realize all of this.  Then, shortly thereafter, nerfs will be called for it.  

Good luck to Famas mains.  The days are numbered if Embark/the community continue down this path.",667,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1g8tjbh/if_1887_gets_nerfed_the_famas_is_next/,1729527167.0,0.1027,880

"Nerfs aside, what about buffing Revolver, Spear, Dual Blades, M23GL, etc. ?","I really don't like Embark's balance team and their take on how to balance the game. It is only my opinion, but I do believe their balance team is inexperienced—if not, they're borderline incompetent.

I will not talk about the plethora of issues I have with how they balance things, such as the unnecessary/over-the-top nerfs instead of doing like any other competitive game and nerfing by increment, or their misuse of game data excluding important factors such as elo or winrate per pick-rate, etc. That's not the subject of this post.

I'm just curious about the 'forgotten ones', the weapons that have not been viable for more than a season.

**Revolver, Spear, Dual Blades, M23GL** are those that came first to my mind, but there are also some other weapons that desperately need QoL improvements. Like the **KS23** that, imo, needs to have a fixed spread between hipfire and ADS like all other shotguns. Let's not forget the **93r** too, that struggles even after all the buffs it received. The only thing those buffs did was make the weapon go from terrible to just bad.

There are also the issues with other weapons that have been recently changed.

For example, the **V9S** was bugged after its last nerf ; it had a bugged animation when using the scope, the bullets didn't go where they should. You can check with crosshairX or a screen crosshair in the practice range if you're curious. I think that bug is related to the rof change.

Although less frequently than before the fix, the **sword** still has that teleportation issue when using RMB. Idk if it's related to the coding of the weapon or the server backend, but that's one more a bug that appearing after a recent change to the weapon.

Back to the topic, I really hope Embark will pause their nerfing spree for a moment and spend some time to improve the weapons that can't perform well.

\- **Revolver** became a worse DMR due to the range fallof nerf in january. Even more so now with the pike. Either make it a true CQC/medium range precision gun with high skillcap, or improve its potency at range by reducing the recoil or reverting the nerf to the range fallof. In any case, it really deserves a buff.

\- **Spear** has never been viable since its release. We should be able to disable the RMB by clicking one more time without having to emote cancel and be useless for a few sec. Embark should also think of reworking its damage model, either by changing the breakpoints or the damage/attack speed of LMB. Rn there's no reason to pick the spear over the sledge—and it's not just because of the lack of utility.

\- **Dual Blades** are similar to the spear, in the sense that they have never been viable since their release. Tbf I like the Dual Blade and the weapon's RMB is quite unique compared to the Riot Shield and other melees, but it's still not enough to make it good. It's easy to counter, and the weapons has terrible breakpoints for a melee. It also doesn't help that each attack is 2 hits, messing the breakpoints even more if 1 hit miss for some reason. This also highlight the issue of melee on mediums, who have neither higher speed / gap closers like lights, or survivability / CC tools like heavies.

\- **M23GL** is in an awkward spot where the rare people who use it are either masochist OTP, or random people trying to make the weapon work for the 32165th time. Is it fun to play ? Yes. Is it good ? No. There are plenty of ways to improve the MGL without making it op like they did with the CL. They could buff the projectile speed, reduce the detonation delay, increase the rof or reload speed, etc. The ideas aren't lacking, they just need to do something so it's not so frustrating to be so useless in a direct gunfight with the MGL.",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1gh0h8e/nerfs_aside_what_about_buffing_revolver_spear/,1730448722.0,-0.9947,3735
Can revolver get a small tweak?,"I absolutely love the revolver it being my 2nd main weapons for medium along with riot shield, but my biggest problem with it is the headshot & damage overall, it literally does 148 headshot damage

148, and a light has 150 health

Do you know how unsatisfying it is to land a lucky headshot on a light in close range with the revolver? (which it is notoriously bad at) only for it to leave them at a whopping 2 HP?

Its the same energy as valorant's revolver doing 145 damage headshot, just short of the 150hp every person has

Why not just make the revolver a precision focused weapon and have it do 150 headshots and 70 for bodyshots? (It should be 75 as per the headshot rule which is 2x damage, but 75 per shot to kill a light in 2 hits would be unfair), this would still mean lights take 3 body shots to kill, 4 for mediums and 5 for heavies, but hit your headshots and it's 1 2 3 respectively

This also gives players the choice between 2 similar weapons, either the consistency & range of the pike, or the accuracy & power of the revolver, would you rather have 12 reliable bullets you can put down range at a reasonable speed? Or put your faith in 6 rounds and aim just a little bit higher?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1h3pzuk/can_revolver_get_a_small_tweak/,1733011051.0,-0.9886,1199

Hot Take: The Finals is balanced very well and Embark doesn't need to nerf anything right now.,"People ask for nerfs way too much here. There's always something that people laser-focus complain about in this subreddit, then once it's nerfed, they just move onto the next thing. Most of the time, this community isn't even talking about the most imbalanced thing at the time.

Perfect example: the model 1887. This is the current focus of balancing discussions here. This weapon hasn't been touched since launch and has been powerful the entire time, it still gets beat at range by every ranged weapon, and is a skill cannon. You need to learn the reload and land your shots or the TTK skyrockets. Can anyone pick this weapon up and dominate a lobby? No. It's not OP.

Is this game perfectly balanced? No. Is it as bad as some people act? Not even close.


Edit: I just want to clarify, a lot of things have been nerfed, especially heavy.

*There needs to be more focus on buffs.*

I've explained in a couple of comments, one linked below, but to keep it short, I think buffing H defensive options and giving glitch mines to H would indirectly fix a lot of things. Team comp balance would be better, H would be picked more and better fill the niche it's supposed to fill. Defensive H's would challenge L and M in close range more. Less M and L in lobbies would mean 1887 is less effective without nerfing it. Giving H glitch mines fit with the defensive fortress playstyle of H and directly counter M. That just makes sense to me.

Buff the revolver damage and range,"The revolver urgently needs at least +1 damage to kill the light with two shots, the revolver leaves the light with 2 hp with a headshot or two shots to the body, if it had +1 damage it would already be good, if it had +2 damage it would be great for a weapon not as strong as the revolver.

Another problem is the range, for a revolver the range is terrible, at 50 meters it's easier to kill a medium with the V95 than with the revolver, the revolver is definitely the weirdest weapon in the game and needs a little more polishing.

Here's a video that shows how bad the revolver's range is: https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/s/wmMcZR4WPP",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1g97yt4/buff_the_revolver_damage_and_range/,1729564954.0,-0.9744,640

Why do so many people hate the Model 1887 all of a sudden?,"This gun has remained unchanged since S1 and just now I'm seeing so many people complain about it here and on the official Discord.

Main complaint I see people make, is that the Model deals too much damage at range and they will get half their HP deleted from across the map. The only 2 ways I see this happening are: they get shot multiple times from afar and don't do anything (I have seen so many people do this) OR they consider 20 meters to be across the map. Because at longer rages, the Model basically just peppers people and it only has 6 shots that you shouldn't waste on a heavy on the other side of the map

  
Another very common complaint is that a skilled Model player is very frustrating to play against. But that is the case for all weapons, someone who is very good at using a certain gun is going to be very annoying to play against, A good sword dash light is almost impossible to hit and can wipe a team if they're too close from each other, a heavy that is good with MGL32 can deal some crazy chip damage from a far, etc.

I think people are now just complaining about the Model because the AK and the FCAR got nerfed. 

So what we nerf every decent weapon until we they are all trash?

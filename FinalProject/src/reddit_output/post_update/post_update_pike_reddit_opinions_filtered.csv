"Not really sure I understand the pike nerf, it made basically no difference","The pike still kills in the same amount of shots for light and medium which was the big issue. So essentially the gun wasnt nerfed at all. I can literally click as fast as I can and the recoil is so minimal I hit every shot and absolutely delete people.

It's still way too op in its current form. I’m tired of using it because everyone else is using it",47,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1g6cgmg/not_really_sure_i_understand_the_pike_nerf_it/,1729236334.0,-0.8428,353

What are some of your unpopular opinions on The Finals?,"I’d say they’ve gotten lazy with the battle passes. Season one has the best one in terms of creativity. This season’s battle items are bland and generic. The two pike skins are almost indistinguishable from the default. Also since I’m already here can we keep ranked and WT badges from previous seasons so we can equip them to our player card? Kinda like how apex let’s you keep ranked badges, because I don’t see the point in having the WT badges state the season it’s from when at the end you can’t keep it.",597,https://i.redd.it/595rarad390e1.jpeg,1731321386.0,0.3197,509

"If 1887 gets nerfed, the Famas is next.","This community really needs to chill.  The nerf this and nerf that is an ever revolving cycle.  There are really only 3 viable medium guns that do exceptional damage to each class: the 1887, Pike, and Famas.  The AKM, FCAR, and CL40 all got nerfed and revolver might as well not exist.  Once the pike and 1887 get nerfed, the Famas will be the new target.  

Famas is my 3rd fav medium gun behind 1887 and CL40, so I've got some decent experience on it.  In hip fire, the accuracy is insane and does crazy burst damage.  Now, with the new scope, it shreds even more at range and getting easier headshots.  Famas is truly an all arounder.  Once people are shepered in to using it from the nerfs, they'll realize all of this.  Then, shortly thereafter, nerfs will be called for it.  

Good luck to Famas mains.  The days are numbered if Embark/the community continue down this path.",666,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1g8tjbh/if_1887_gets_nerfed_the_famas_is_next/,1729527167.0,0.1027,880

Which weapon do you like more: LH1 or Pike .556?,"For me, I like the LH1 a lot more and I think it is better than the Pike .556 for several reasons:

1. Faster fire rate
2. Higher headshot damage
3. Generally better TTK across all classes

(I like playing light class)

Also, I think the scope makes the LH1 a lot better

Pike rebalance idea,We all know the pike was broken in the finals when it first came out. But my god they really did it dirty with the nerfs. We all know damn well ain't nobody use the pike for it's long range. Anyway here's the rebalance. Buff the damage to where it was previously. Nerf the damage fall off or whatever to what it was before. Slower the fire rate so the ttk isnt as fast or something. Also remove visual recoil cause it fucking sucks. And maybe lower the mag size slightly. Now you got a good weapon that isn't shit and people don't complain about. I forgot from which YouTuber I got this opinion from btw but props to them for having good balance ideas.,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1h54iwo/pike_rebalance_idea/,1733170492.0,-0.9059,652

Pike bug? Bullets fly way to high,"I just played a game with the Pike 556 and whenever I would scope in, my bullets went way high. I wasn't able to hit anything. Confirmed by shooting a wall as well. The bullets hit where the crosshair ends up after the recoil animation goes through, right before the crosshair centers again. 

Restarted the game and played a new match and the same thing happened.

I play mouse and keyboard. Other weapons with scope didn't have the issue. I tried the sniper for example and it worked as expected.

Did anybody else experience this yet? Maybe a new bug?",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1gdqo7p/pike_bug_bullets_fly_way_to_high/,1730078757.0,0.6966,554

Revolver needs a buff,"There’s no reason to use the revolver when you could use something like the pike or either of the autos. It’s outclassed by literally every other semi auto in the game, LH1, KS-23, sniper, Pike all out play the revolver simply because they either hit harder, have more range, or are more accurate. I can’t count the amount of times I’ve been in a 1v1 against a light using LH1 and lose out simply because one bullet misses, therefore I propose a visual recoil reduction. 

It really doesn’t need any crazy changes because it’s a solid gun as is, and the 2x headshot multiplier is super strong. However, you can’t even consistently hit headshots because you have a seizure everytime you pull the trigger. I would like a bit of a range buff to contend with the pike a little better, but really all it needs is to be more comfortable to shoot. Hell, akimbo deagles feel more accurate at range when you’re technically hipfiring 2, 50 caliber monsters. If the revolver felt more like the way deagle shoots it would be a lot better of a weapon.

Lets talk nerfs that can be reverted,"Wanted to see peoples thoughts on some nerf reversions from some of the items in the game that have seen excessive nerfs:
Heavies
-rpg- now that it only does 100 damage, can we get some better accuracy while in motion, and can we remove the double self damage?
-dome shield- now that it has really low health, can we have the original time for deployment?
-mesh shield- now that it can’t be cycled and heal beam has been nerfed, maybe a touch more health?
-c4- now that nukes are long dead and gone, maybe an up to the damage or map destruction? Maybe go back to 2 charges?
-winch claw- give back the 15m range and extra 10 damage?

Medium
-magnum-slightly less visual recoil?
-cl40- remove the double self damage?

Light
-sniper- maybe this is a comment towards other guns, but why does the only long range weapon have severe bullet drop when the mid range weapons like lh1 and pike don’t?
-breach charge- same as heavy c4. This item needs some love because thermal bore is just a ranged version of this
-thermal vision- remove the tablet?
-glitch grenade- slightly longer explosion time? Help it keep up to glitch mine

General
-gas- it used to do a lot more damage. Considering pyro is so common and deletes gas, maybe revert some of the damage. It kind of does a worse job then fire now and just gets removed by fire. 
-health regens-heavy could use some love in the health regen department now that heal beam is aligned. Thinking either a quicker regen delay, or a minimum amount of damage needed to stop the healing? One measly uzi round doesn’t have to stop that healing after such a long delay.

Sword is fine. Sword + dash is the problem.,"I was going to wait until the next sword is OP need nerf thread to drop this tid-bit but I am not on reddit enough. So here it is, it's the combo of sword+dash breaking the casuals, being able to extend the poke's range is what most don't like about it.

I see no one using sword + invis, and few use sword + hook. It's the sword + dash combo that's people hate. The swords fine if you change any of the sword numbers it might make it unusable.

So my thought is just have using the dash cancel out the he sword poke. It'll still gut the weapon but it'll make the casuals happy with out absolutely fucking over all sword mains.

Sorry my swordtards I feel you, mastering it is fun as all hell but we should admit it is also unfun to go against. I hope just that embark is smarter then I and will make everyone happy with what ever the do with sword.

Played a few hours of Ranked Tournament with the KS-23(slug shotgun) and...,"...is it supposed to be trash, or am I missing some vital tricks? Low Rate of Fire in addition to the 5 second reload time with a very awkward reload interrupt that leaves you very open as a slow and clumsy class to begin with, coupled with no headshots doesn't cut it against any automatic weapon or if you do manage a kill you are left with very low health.

The wiki claims that it has high damage against structures. It takes about 3-4 shots to go through a concrete wall, which is 50-60% of your six shot magazine. Sentries go down in 3-4 shots and canisters don't explode on a single hit.

Is there some techniques that I'm oblivious to or some loadout that brings out the inner beauty of this beefy shotgun or am I just barking up the wrong tree here?

Shotguns are some of my favorite weapons along with Revolvers and Grenade Launchers so it's kinda sad to see a slug shotgun be this anemic.",72,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1gsyej4/played_a_few_hours_of_ranked_tournament_with_the/,1731795095.0,-0.9722,899
Things I'm hoping for in S5+,"* Map variants for Horizon & Fortune Stadium
* More map variants and non-punishing game events
* Remove dispersion from RPG
* Add a tactical reload for Flamethrower
* Double mag size + double rof for Flamethrower, half dmg (so it actually is more like a continuous stream)
* Removal/reversal of support score from shielding
* Sprays added to Barricades customizable options
* Something to make Barricades more consistent
* Something to reduce the ever-growing Medium meta
* Tap, double tap, and long press options for keybindings
* Customizable ping wheel
* Sorry added to ping wheel
* Text on console
* Voices de-coupled from faces
* Spectator mode
* How long a friend has been in a game + what game mode + what round
* Add whisper functionality for better social interactions
* Thermal vision to work like Cloak/invis
* EDIT: Pyro/Gas grenades to have increased lethality or decreased cooldown + larger aoe or 2 charges, or Frags dmg reduced or charges brought down to 1 (currently frags are by and large the grenade to pick across all elos, so clearly something needs to change) (frags could also have some visual indicator added to them)
* EDIT: â€‹FCAR and mp5 to have an identity as heavier, alternative options to their counterparts. (The way Lewis Gun vs m60 is now is great and should be adopted by FCAR vs akm and mp5 vs m11)
* Assists to be added as an option for Player Cards
* Chromas for skins to be bought with VRsâ€‹
* CL-40 self dmg reduced (1.6x to self is extremely punishing for a primary weapon)
* stun gun rework",25,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1gus7mv/things_im_hoping_for_in_s5/,1732003238.0,0.9167,1530

I don't think you guys realize how diabolical the Lockbolt Launcher and Gravity Vortex combo is going to be.,"Light tosses a Gravity Vortex, entire team get sucked in, heavy uses Lockbolt Launcher to pin them and a Dome Shield to mitigate damage. Entire friendly team unloads. Even more diabolical with the CL-40 and grenade gadgets like gas or fire.

Season 5 patch notes if I was king of THE FINALS,"This is going to be interesting...

# Balance Changes

**Archetypes**  
Light

* Increased health from 150 to 175

*Dev Note: The greater health disparity that Light had compared to Medium and Heavy made it extremely difficult to balance weapons. A weapon could be too strong against Light, and weak against Medium and Heavy. In addition, we believe the additional 25 health will encourage Light players to ""play with their team,"" as now they have slightly better survivability.*

* Decreased the time it takes for the Light class to steal Cashouts from 7 seconds to 5 seconds
* Decreased the time it takes for the Vault to open when triggered by Light from 20 seconds to 13 seconds.
* Light counts as two players when on the platform in Power Shift

*Dev Note: The community has pointed out that Light fails to offer meaningful team utility that Medium and Heavy don't already provide, and that Light players rarely play for the objective. With this in mind, we've decided to lean into the nature of the class- speed, when making these changes.*

Heavy

* Increased arena damage for all hit-scan Heavy weapons, with arena damage falloff, effectively allowing Heavies to break walls in a reasonable amount of time with their weapons alone, within a reasonable distance

**Specializations**

Goo Gun

* Removed Goo Gun as a specialization

Mesh Shield

* Decreased Mesh Shield cooldown from 8s to 2s after being closed

Winch Claw

* Players can now use their weapons and gadgets while being winched
* Winch Claw can now be used to ""grab"" destructible surfaces, winch them in, and break them

**Gadgets**

Defibrillator

* Revive animation can now be canceled by being glitched

Explosive Mine

* Increased max damage from 120 to 140
* Increased cooldown from 15s to 30s
* Increased ammo count from 1 to 2

Glitch Grenade

* Changed to explode on impact

*Dev Note: This change was made particularly to take advantage of Defibrillator's new mechanic, as well as an overall increase in the speed that the glitch effect can be delivered.*

* Glitch effect now travels to players attached by Healing Beam.

Stun Gun

* Removed (lol screw this thing)

**New Gadgets**

Regenerator (Medium)

* A placeable structure that heals teammates within a couple meters of it.

*Dev Note: This gadget has been added to the Medium loadout to help players feel like they can detach themselves from Healing Beam without putting themselves at a severe competitive disadvantage.*

Goo Gun (Heavy)

* Has 2 charges that are activated on reload, with a 30 second cooldown.

*Dev Note: The Heavy archetype was formerly the only class to have more than three specializations. It became apparent that Goo Gun was an underperformer in that category. So instead of removing it, we decided the keep it as a gadget. This way it can be used in several ways, additional movement-or goovement, and fortification, which the Heavy class is known for.*

**Weapons**

M26 Matter

* Increased fire rate from 85 RPM to 95 RPM

93R

* Increased firing speed within each burst from 1000 RPMs to 1200 RPMs
* Decreased the delay between bursts from 0.275s to 0.25s
* Increased magazine capacity from 21 to 24
* Added the option to attach a weapon sight

R .359

* Decreased bullet dispersion significantly when firing â€˜from the hipâ€™ when crouching, crouch moving, standing still, running, and in â€˜uncontrolledâ€™ states such as falling or sliding
* Decreased headshot damage multiplier from 2.0x to 1.5x

CL-40

* Increased max damage from 100 to 110
* Decreased ammo from 5 to 4
* Decreased self-damage multiplier from 1.6 to 1.0
* Adjusted splash damage to fall of linearly from the point of impact, -1% every centimeter
* Added damage fall-off, starting at 30m and ending at 40m. Max damage fall-off is 50%
* Reduced audio and visual noise

*Dev Note: We recognize that the CL-40 at the beginning of season 4 appeared to be over-tuned and annoying. These changes are an attempt to make the CL-40 a viable alternative to other Medium weapons, without being so disruptive.*

FCAR

* Decreased reload time from 2.10s to 1.90s

Spear

* Removed existing alt-fire attack
* Added alt-fire throw; 100 damage

KS-23

* Increased magazine capacity from 6 to 8
* Increased damage from 100 to 110

MGL-32

* Grenades now do 70 damage on projectile impact (and still only explode on the second impact)

"This game nees more experimental Gadgets, Specials, and Enviornmentals.","For me, what caused me to love this game at 1st site, was the question of what I could put together to make a strategy work. And what things I could use in parallel to acheive my goal. Like how fire kills gas and goo, or putting explsoives or turrets on objects and throwing em, we need more stuff like this, Imagine remote explosives that can do glitch, gas, and flame stuff. Or a gas grenade launcher (with smaller gas clouds ofc), How about A 50 cal for the heavy, It would be great for heavys to place accurate shots on far away sniping lights, or play a distant support role. Imagine glich mines that explode with glitch (unlike the mediums) Imagine the heavy having placeable bombardments like mortars or mounted machine guns, maybe have light medium and large dynamic object that only their respective classes can pick up (while retaining all old ones), imagine the heavy picking up like a dumpster or one of the casino machines. idk, its fun to have more variety to be able to experiment with stratagies and such.",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1h0wkth/this_game_nees_more_experimental_gadgets_specials/,1732683555.0,0.9751,1021
Some neat ideas!,"Not here to play gamedev or worry about minute details regarding balancing. Just thought I had some cool ideas for gear that yall might like to read about:)

Equipment- concussion grenade for Heavy and Medium
Much like Fortniteâ€™s impulse grenade, it sends out a shockwave on impact. Does no damage, but sends players, rubble, cash boxes and canisters flying. It would only come in singles and have a decently long recharge time, but the possible shenanigans and strategy would be worth a slot.

Equipment- claymore for Light, medium, and Heavy
Classic COD-style claymore, it deals damage in a wide cone similar to a shotgun blast, depending on the direction itâ€™s placed in. Placement is indicated with a trip-laser beam, and itâ€™s capable of dealing chip damage to multiple players if theyâ€™re stacked on one another. Comes in stacks of 2, with the same cooldown properties as the mines.

Loadout- Tower Shield for Heavy
A crowd-control option with similar damage blocking properties to the mediumâ€™s riot shield and baton- and the primary attack dealing damage comparable to the spear.
The right click/left trigger holds the shield up, and hitting your primary button performs a shield bash- dealing considerable damage and a slightly comedic amount of knockback. A good counter for ankle biting melee lights, (youâ€™re valid, just being honest ;) ) and Iâ€™d imagine it would be a nasty combo with charge and slam.

Loadout- Riot Shotgun for Medium
Tube fed, semi auto- think a Spas-12 or Benelli M3! Itâ€™s got a faster fire rate and reload, at the cost of a wider spread and quicker damage drop off than the Model 1887â€¦ with the exception of dealing more damage up close. The ammo capacity is an awkward 5 rounds, so the best use case is to duck in and out of a fight to give a short burst of shots.

Loadout- Beanbag GL for Light
A single-barrel Grenade Launcher fit with high impact, low accuracy beanbag rounds. The rounds themselves deal around 75-100 dmg, pushing targets away and slowing their forward momentum for a short bit. Thereâ€™s no ADS, itâ€™s from the hip like the KS-23 and the reload is comparable to the Thermite Bore, as they are both the same base gun. This gunâ€™s best used as an opener, softening up and momentarily disorienting targets for a follow up from grenades, traps, or teammates. (Also a direct counter to some of the heavyâ€™s offerings.)

Gadget- Adrenaline for Heavy
Exceedingly long recharge- upwards 2 minutes. For about 15 seconds, gives the user a base speed boost to everything- sprinting, reloading, throwing, and cuts incoming damage in half. A scary combo with any melee weapon or semi-auto gun.

Gadget- Healing Ring for Medium
Another long recharge. Plants a device that slowly heals every player in its AOE, friend or not. Can be destroyed, and has a relatively short despawn of 10 seconds. Its total output from start to finish could be around 70-100 HP.

And thatâ€™ll do it! Iâ€™d love to hear any ideas or recommendations.
Please. Itâ€™s been a slow day at work.",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1gq00cq/some_neat_ideas/,1731457520.0,-0.9874,2994
Some Gadget ideas. ,"I got a couple gadgets I'd like to see. Let me know if any of these sound fun.

--Smoke Machine (light and heavy): throw it down and it will create a cloud of smoke in the area. 2 charges 10 second recharge time. 
-Why: Could be insane on defense to keep fire from destroying goo and generally help gas be more of a threat if it can't be burned.

--heal nade (medium and light): throw it to instantly heals 50 hp and starts health regen. 10 second cooldown.
-Why: spread the healing across gadgets to help make medium less of a ""do it all class"" and so those who want to be a healer can still be one. 

--Heal Station(medium and heavy): a mine like device that heals 1 player near it prioritizing the one with the lowest health. It can heal 200 total hp at 20 hp per second. 20 second cool down. cool down is reduced based on how much health is left in the station up to 50%. 
-Why: similar to the heal nade spread healing around to multiple gadgets. 

--deringer or pocket pistol (heavy and light): short range 2 shot pistol that's a gadget that deals 75 dmg up to 10 meters and 50 past 10 meters. 6 second cooldown, max of 4 charges. 
-why: meant to be a close range option for those who pick sniper or the grenade launcher or a range increase to those playing melee or flamethrower.

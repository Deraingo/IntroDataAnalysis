Hot take I guess? PIKE isn’t OP.,"The pike isn’t really THAT good. It’s strong yes, but OP? I’m not seeing it.

I’m seeing so much complaining about it and I’m not understanding. A DMR hits hard…?

It has a slow fire rate, low capacity, meh hip fire, and high damage. I don’t see how you can nerf it without making it bad. It’s just another one of those weapons where balancing it is a nightmare. It’s either gonna be really good or really bad.

Season 4 has only been out for 1 day. Can we give it some time before we start calling for nerfs on a weapon that hasn’t even settled in yet? ",134,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1fqkgff/hot_take_i_guess_pike_isnt_op/,1727432441.0,-0.758,554
Pike and Demat are a beautiful combination. ,,626,https://v.redd.it/cc3db4digkrd1,1727536360.0,0.0,0
We need to talk about the Pike and the Medium meta we're in right now,"The ttk of this weapon is already one of the best amongst the Medium's arsenal, but coupled with the fire rate, mag size, hipfire accuracy, and near lack of recoil; it blows out not just everything on Medium, but everything else in the game.

You can view the data yourself using these 3 sources:

* [spreadsheet with ttk values across all weapons](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1Ud7Rdl3AgMw9mmfDwW2LtDMnzZQ9IIhnqSE4ivsaMTs/htmlview)
* [great video by Appoh going more in-depth on what makes the Pike so strong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B7h0zSFrX8)
* [practice range of all the new weapons that also shows the recoil pattern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjD6YbKJEiY)

For those of you who were here early season 1; I'm sure you can agree that this feels just as, if not more, oppressive than FCAR + Recon Sense Mediums. And far worse than Model 1887 spam the 2nd half of last season.

I'm seeing post after post after post of screenshots of all Medium lobbies, and seeing little to no Heavys in my games. But the lack of Heavy representation requires its own post. However, it must be pointed out that the inclusion of the Pike and the CL-40 buff are not the only things factoring into this. The nerf, and subsequent absence, of Mesh Shield has left a void in the meta that makes way for players to run at teams with blind abandon and come out on top more often than not.

I know there is a vocal majority that's okay with the state of the game (and the state of the Pike), but you have to take it with a grain of salt when the majority of the playerbase only plays 2-3 hrs a week with an emphasis on the casual game modes. Someone with 400+ hrs in the game with that time primarily in the competitive modes is going to inherently have a better understanding of the game than someone with <100 hrs. The game should not be balanced around the casual modes; it is a competitive, objective-based shooter with casual modes.

Listening to the vocal majority, casual players, is how we ended up with the removal of team wipes in World Tour / Cashout Tournament last season; which you immediately re-instated. Or how we got a Sniper nerf; a weapon not strong by any metric outside of Power Shift and sometimes Terminal Attack. Sniper wasn’t the problem with Power Shift; it was long-range, uncontestable dmg which the Pike and LH1 have filled in those game modes.

* [patch notes where you cover the breakdown of the playerbase](https://www.reachthefinals.com/patchnotes/cashoutblog)

I know this is an unpopular opinion, but the game is experiencing the worst balance period since early season 1 and it will only get worse as more people play Medium to combat Medium because they’ll feel they have no other options.

**tl;dr:** The nerf to Heavy and the buffs to Medium + Inclusion of the Pike have resulted in an overwhelmingly oppressive Medium meta

For context: I've been playing since Open Beta 1, have 800+ hrs in the game, and was Emerald 3 (almost 2) last season

Can yall please chill about the Pike?,"I understand the frustration of not knowing how to handle something new to the game, as it means your existing plays and strategies no longer apply. It's only been two days though, please allow it for two seconds before crying about it just yet.

Seeing a constant stream of ""nerf pike it's op"" with zero reasoning or thought is a major fucking drag. It's not constructive or helpful at all. Just a constant drip feed of ""nerf pike"" spam.

As it stands, the gun does 59 dmg on body, and around 88 on head. This feels like a reasonable amount. It 2 taps a Light with headshots, 3 taps a Medium with headshots, and 4 taps a Heavy. If it shifts any lower the gun becomes basically totally non-viable against Heavy(/Medium ish).

If you have an actual reason for your dislike of the gun I'd like to hear it! Feel free to use this as a place to discuss the actual functionality of the pike and how you'd like to see it changed. Just no more useless whinging. Please.

"If 1887 gets nerfed, the Famas is next.","This community really needs to chill.  The nerf this and nerf that is an ever revolving cycle.

Once the pike and 1887 get nerfed, the Famas will be the new target.  

Famas is my 3rd fav medium gun behind 1887 and CL40, so I've got some decent experience on it.  In hip fire, the accuracy is insane and does crazy burst damage.  Now, with the new scope, it shreds even more at range and getting easier headshots.  Famas is truly an all arounder.  Once people are shepered in to using it from the nerfs, they'll realize all of this.  Then, shortly thereafter, nerfs will be called for it.

The problem with the Pike (and other weapons). ,"I think most semi automatic weapons are really difficult to use when playing on console just because the advantage mouse has aiming. It's like these weapons are designed to be used exclusively with MnK. This is really evident with the Pike, light pistol, and especially the sword. Almost every light with sword or medium with pike I see destroying a lobby is on pc. Using sword with mouse you can turn incredibly fast and be perfectly accurate. And using semi auto guns is easier with mouse, because every shot counts, unlike ARs that you can miss a couple of shots and still win the fight. I know a lot of people here like to think that AA in controller is like aimbotting, but it really isn't. I'm a Medium/Light main btw.

"[Competitive] Light obsolete again? CL-40, Pike and sights (Famas/AK) huge powerspike making light feel like a bad choice (once more)","Whenever something is strong, lights tend to be the first one pulling the short end of the straw due to their low health pool. Last season, playing light in high emerald (albeit not the best representation, but hey) felt reasonable. Cloak + XP was considered a solid choice.

With this season seeing the CL-40 and Pike being crazy strong and the addition of sights lifting AK and Famas to new heights, lights are often gone before they can even cloak/decloak/whatever. Is anyone else seeing this?

Suggestion: New FCAR rework based off Pike TTKs and V9S damage model.,"IMO, the old FCAR was a TON more fun than the current version (though it was definitely too powerful in the hands of high aim players... and cheaters with aimbots).

The current FCAR is just too similar in function to the AK, with similar fire rates and just a single bullet less on the shots to kill.

It just doesn't feel like a different option, other than the heavy vertical recoil and harder-to-adapt-to pattern making it worse in general.

That said, here's what I'd like to propose:

----

I made a data set comparison between the FCAR I'd like to see and the current FCAR.

-

Current FCAR:

22dmg

577rpm

24rnd mag

2.0s reload

212 DPS

-

Light = 7 body (0.624s TTK) 5 head (0.52s TTK)

Medium = 12 body (1.144s TTK) 8 head (0.728s TTK)

Heavy = 16 body (1.664s TTK) 11 head (1.04s TTK)

---------------------

Modified FCAR:

-

35dmg

340rpm

20rnd mag

2.0s reload

198 DPS

-

Light = 5 body (0.706s TTK) 3 head (0.53s TTK)

Medium = 8 body (1.235s TTK) 5 head (0.706s TTK)

Heavy = 10 body (1.588s TTK) 7 head (1.059s TTK)

----

Now yes, on paper it LOOKS more similar to the V9S at first glance than it's designed to function.

The V9S is specifically built for close ranges, and my FCAR rework stats are based around keeping the current reload speed and terrible recoil pattern.

The V9S has a significantly faster fire rate at 425 RPM, a LIGHTNING fast 1.3s reload speed, better hip fire accuracy, and a near-perfectly vertical recoil pattern (seriously it's legit the easiest pattern to memorize in the game, virtually a straight line up).

It could be the same 37dmg model as the V9S on Light, but I kinda like the idea of the gun being a bit less effective against Medium/Heavy to offset the V9S comparison in closer quarters combat and give the V9S just that much more of an edge up on the FCAR in CQC).

To anyone who thinks the Pike is not overpowered,"It is the first medium weapon that breaks 1k damage in a single mag.

It is the *only* medium weapon capable of theoretically killing 3 heavies without reloading.

(88.5 headshots x 12 shots = 1,062/350 = 3.034)

It is tied with the Model 1887 for being able to kill 2 heavies in a single mag without any headshots.

This alongside both long-range light weapons being nerfed means that pike is extremely oppressive, especially when multiple people are running it.

I am genuinely curious what could possibly be argued in the defense of this, because to me it seems pretty cut and dry, but I obviously might be biased against it as a light main. But that is why I specifically picked heavy as the measuring point. If it can, in theory, kill 3 whole heavies without a reload, then you can imagine how many lights it can kill. 7.08 to be precise, but of course lights are smaller and faster, harder to get headshots on, so maybe that's the balance point, except that it still kills 4.72 lights with bodyshots.

To put it in a different perspective, if you can kill 4.72 lights in a single mag, that means only 1 out of every 4.7 shots needs to hit to kill a single light, meaning you need an accuracy of only 21% to get a kill. That seems extremely forgiving for a weapon that's meant to require precision and aim.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1fsa82j/to_anyone_who_thinks_the_pike_is_not_overpowered/,1727632173.0,-0.9948,1311
Triple CL40 is EVIL,"Just had to say it. Met up with some randoms the other day while I was doing my placement matches for ranked. I happened to have the cl40 on, and these two guys switched to it too. Long story short we played some yesterday and more today, running nothing but triple cl40. Just hit plat today after winning probably 70-80% of our tournaments. Only thing that actually put a stop to our shit was another triple medium team running 3 pikes on the new map. Those guys just beamed us from range consistently. Other than that one team tho, we would just bombard teams with a hail of grenades, and before they can even engage they’ve all been splashed by at least 3 noob tube shots. No amount of people switching to aps could counter the sheer volume of grenades we would spam. Made me feel dirty ",279,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1fvwnu8/triple_cl40_is_evil/,1728040547.0,-0.8422,790
Revolver needs a buff,"There’s no reason to use the revolver when you could use something like the pike or either of the autos. It’s outclassed by literally every other semi auto in the game, LH1, KS-23, sniper, Pike all out play the revolver simply because they either hit harder, have more range, or are more accurate. I can’t count the amount of times I’ve been in a 1v1 against a light using LH1 and lose out simply because one bullet misses, therefore I propose a visual recoil reduction. 

It really doesn’t need any crazy changes because it’s a solid gun as is, and the 2x headshot multiplier is super strong. However, you can’t even consistently hit headshots because you have a seizure everytime you pull the trigger. I would like a bit of a range buff to contend with the pike a little better, but really all it needs is to be more comfortable to shoot. Hell, akimbo deagles feel more accurate at range when you’re technically hipfiring 2, 50 caliber monsters. If the revolver felt more like the way deagle shoots it would be a lot better of a weapon.

How is the CL-40 the main balancing focus on this sub?,"TL;DR: The CL-40 is a mid weapon, isn't META, and won't be. The complaints about it feel blown out of proportion.

The fact that this is the fish that this sub is frying tells me the game is much more balanced than the general vibe of this sub would have you believe.

I play mostly WT and ranked cashout, I'm G3 right now, Diamond in s2, Emerald in s3, I don't know if that matters but heres more info to give you a frame of reference.

I don't even feel like we're playing the same game guys. I see more CL-40s in game now, but it's like, a couple of them. 3-4, and the teams aren't blowing lobbies out of the water. They're doing okay. Powershift I see it a lot, so what game mode are you guys playing to be struggling against the CL40?

I'm a Heavy main, the update most affected me, see bellow from the season 4 update patch notes;

>CL-40

>Increased max damage from 93 to 117

>Dev Note: This change sounds significant, but keeps the weapon in a place where it still takes two shots to kill a Light and three shots to kill a Medium. The change is mostly aimed at making a Heavy three shots to kill instead of four, as we felt it was unfair to the CL-40 to have to land all four of its available four shots (i.e. 100% accuracy) to kill a Heavy without reloading

>Decreased fire rate from 275 RPm to 210 RPM

>Dev Note: A small adjustment to offset the significant damage buff a little.

>Increased the max damage radius from 9cm to 30cm

Here's an updated spreadsheet comparing TTK, STK, across all classes and weapons;

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1Ud7Rdl3AgMw9mmfDwW2LtDMnzZQ9IIhnqSE4ivsaMTs/htmlview?pli=1#gid=2136619021

This weapon has the slowest reload, slowest ROF, lowest mag count, requires even or high ground, and has a direct counter with APS. Dome shield stops %75 of a mag, mesh shield even more.

Double and triple stacking anything is annoying, the CL40 isn't even special in this regard, going against triple PIKE is way worse in S4, how is that not the main concern? I've seen that more than triple CL.

Literally all I need to do as a heavy is get high ground, or, if its a 1v1, shoot them to out DPS them. Anytime I've thrown down a dome shield while pushing a squad of 2 CL users, the shield breaks and they're already low health, we just shoot them and kill them. The only time I've lost was when they have high ground and the jump on us.

I don't even have a 3 stack yall, I'm mostly solo queuing right now, and when I do 3 stack, CL40 isn't even a thought in our mind.

There's so many tools to outplay, and direct counter them, these complaints feel disingenuous.

You don't even need to run APS to counter them if you don't want it, if you have a jump pad, jump and down while fighting them and you should have enough time to force a reload and beat them. If your a light player, dash, dash, dash, or Spiderman to high ground. If you're invis, yes, get fucked, the CL40 is directly countering your annoying, stupid, stun gun, invis, glitch, double barrel, sword, etc, that's been effective since the betas.

Say you literally do not want to run any specific thing to counter them, all you need is high ground, better aim, or positioning.

I didn't want to jump on the ""skill issue"" train, but dang guys, what else is there to say here?

The CL40 was even stronger in S1 and S2, yet people never complained then, so you know what I think is happening? It got buffed so people are trying it, and it turns out it's fun, so people are gonna use it for awhile, but they'll stop soon and go back to more consistent weapons. But if yall literally can't get figure out how to counter it, they'll just keep using it.

This is crazy, the devs may actually nerf a mid weapon based on this feedback, when we just had the best season yet drop with the most powerful new weapons we've seen that literally have changed the META and yall are seriously up in arms because your annoyed about a mid tier weapon.",244,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1fw8h2m/how_is_the_cl40_the_main_balancing_focus_on_this/,1728072396.0,-0.9986,3941

Lets talk nerfs that can be reverted,"Wanted to see peoples thoughts on some nerf reversions from some of the items in the game that have seen excessive nerfs:
Heavies
-rpg- now that it only does 100 damage, can we get some better accuracy while in motion, and can we remove the double self damage?
-dome shield- now that it has really low health, can we have the original time for deployment?
-mesh shield- now that it can’t be cycled and heal beam has been nerfed, maybe a touch more health?
-c4- now that nukes are long dead and gone, maybe an up to the damage or map destruction? Maybe go back to 2 charges?
-winch claw- give back the 15m range and extra 10 damage?

Medium
-magnum-slightly less visual recoil?
-cl40- remove the double self damage?

Light
-sniper- maybe this is a comment towards other guns, but why does the only long range weapon have severe bullet drop when the mid range weapons like lh1 and pike don’t?
-breach charge- same as heavy c4. This item needs some love because thermal bore is just a ranged version of this
-thermal vision- remove the tablet?
-glitch grenade- slightly longer explosion time? Help it keep up to glitch mine

General
-gas- it used to do a lot more damage. Considering pyro is so common and deletes gas, maybe revert some of the damage. It kind of does a worse job then fire now and just gets removed by fire. 
-health regens-heavy could use some love in the health regen department now that heal beam is aligned. Thinking either a quicker regen delay, or a minimum amount of damage needed to stop the healing? One measly uzi round doesn’t have to stop that healing after such a long delay.

Sword is fine. Sword + dash is the problem.,"I was going to wait until the next sword is OP need nerf thread to drop this tid-bit but I am not on reddit enough. So here it is, it's the combo of sword+dash breaking the casuals, being able to extend the poke's range is what most don't like about it.

I see no one using sword + invis, and few use sword + hook. It's the sword + dash combo that's people hate. The swords fine if you change any of the sword numbers it might make it unusable.

So my thought is just have using the dash cancel out the he sword poke. It'll still gut the weapon but it'll make the casuals happy with out absolutely fucking over all sword mains.

Sorry my swordtards I feel you, mastering it is fun as all hell but we should admit it is also unfun to go against. I hope just that embark is smarter then I and will make everyone happy with what ever the do with sword.

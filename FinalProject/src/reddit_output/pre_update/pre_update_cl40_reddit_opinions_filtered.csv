Triple CL40 is EVIL,"Just had to say it. Met up with some randoms the other day while I was doing my placement matches for ranked. I happened to have the cl40 on, and these two guys switched to it too. Long story short we played some yesterday and more today, running nothing but triple cl40. Just hit plat today after winning probably 70-80% of our tournaments. Only thing that actually put a stop to our shit was another triple medium team running 3 pikes on the new map. Those guys just beamed us from range consistently. Other than that one team tho, we would just bombard teams with a hail of grenades, and before they can even engage they’ve all been splashed by at least 3 noob tube shots. No amount of people switching to aps could counter the sheer volume of grenades we would spam.

The only 3 changes needed for CL40 for it to remain fair,"S4 I've played a ton with and against CL40. Whilst it's fun to see it be revived back to relevancy, it's rough edges are what make the weapon not fair. Just 3 things need changing.

- A slight increase in time between shots, like 0.5 seconds at most. 
- Whilst a staggered reload is realistic, it should probably be changed to similarly to the 1887 reload where if you reload from null, you have to complete the whole reload. This leaves the burst potencial intact but you gotta be more careful about when you decide to engage as disengagement leaves you more vulnerable.
- And for the love of god, why is self damage lower than outgoing damage to enemies? There's nothing preventing you from running next to a medium, shooting at your own legs and you'll either kill them faster or both die from splash damage? TF? Heavy's RPG took this nerf where if they shoot too close, they actually take more self DMG than the enemies so RPG can't be used carelessly.

The CL40 is not broken. And could help new players.,"I've been playing since season 1. And I had only ever used it in season 2. But I heard it was broken. So I tried it out for a few games and.... Overwhelming eh. I mean, it's a good gun. But nowhere near overpowered. I've never had trouble countering it, as it's useless at AK range, and barely passable at pistol range. Yeah, ya'll are coping so hard. I reckon the problem is that new players are struggling to cope with the fast paced and dynamic environments and gunplay of the finals, let alone with trying to aim at the same time.

"If 1887 gets nerfed, the Famas is next.","This community really needs to chill.  The nerf this and nerf that is an ever revolving cycle.  There are really only 3 viable medium guns that do exceptional damage to each class: the 1887, Pike, and Famas.  The AKM, FCAR, and CL40 all got nerfed and revolver might as well not exist.  Once the pike and 1887 get nerfed, the Famas will be the new target.  

Famas is my 3rd fav medium gun behind 1887 and CL40, so I've got some decent experience on it.  In hip fire, the accuracy is insane and does crazy burst damage.  Now, with the new scope, it shreds even more at range and getting easier headshots.  Famas is truly an all arounder.  Once people are shepered in to using it from the nerfs, they'll realize all of this.  Then, shortly thereafter, nerfs will be called for it.

How am I supposed to fight against CL40 as a Light?,"I have been a light main since I started playing the Finals, I am using Knives and Evasive dash as of now. I was able to hold my own against all classes with their weapons, even now I'm comfortable against Akimbo, Pike, Model, etc. I'm not saying I'm really good or anything but I know I can fight against and defeat my opponents when I'm with my team. However, All of this changes when there's even one guy with a CL-40, I can't kill them, It's so unbelievably easy for anyone on any skill level to just kill me now as long as they have the CL40, I can't even hide behind my team, even if there's heavys in my team, the shields have been nerfed to the ground as well so my heavys can't protect me anymore.

I know a lot of people are frustrated because of all the complaining but I just can't fight them as a Light, no matter how hard I try. My hp is too low for that fight, Evasive dash doesn't do anything because they don't need to have good aim anymore, I used to appreciate Mids with good aim but this is just bs.

The CL40 Really Isn't That Overpowered,"I want to preface this immediately by saying that I am not claiming that the cl 40 should not be nerfed. It should. I'll go ahead and get it right out of the way, I think the self-damage blast radius should be a bit bigger and more significant, and I think the blast radius in general should be smaller to make it a little bit more of a skill to do Max damage against enemies. This is gonna get long but I'll try not to rant too long.

However, I have been using it and I've been playing against it pretty much all season and I've gathered up a lot of information that I think everyone should know because it can definitely help you in playing against it. 

In my personal opinion, I think that a lot of people that say the CL 40 is overpowered are just bad. The several times that I've won tournaments with the CL 40, it is purely because players are either not playing well, or are not using any of the counter plays that are available to them. However, and a lot of other games, we get our asses beat super bad because they know how to play against us and they can handle it without freaking out and panicking. 

So how exactly? Well one of the most consistent counter weapons to use is the shotguns. The Model 1887 ESPECIALLY rocks. It has such a great range and a tight spread that if you're not doing a bunch of movement or if the enemy is good at aiming, you're gonna get beat every time. I'm pretty sure it just outguns the CL40.

Movement in general is actually a very good counter against a lot of cl40 players. Dash and jump pads and even zip lines can be a huge cripple against CL 40 because, let's say you're a light and you have a sword, you can just Dash and harass me and I'm going to end up hurting myself more than actually hurting you, because I'm basically shooting at myself to try to hurt you as you dash into me while hitting me with your sword but because you're also dashing so frequently you're taking minimal damage from the blast radius of every grenade shot. Harassing and getting into their face like that with sword, even Riot Shield will usually win that fight.

Long range weapons like the pike, lh1, FAMAS, are also fair ways of fighting them. Get high ground, if the CL40 user is on the ground, even with a jump pad they're, in my experience, powerless. Those grenades don't move that fast and they have to get the arc right anyway so it's not that hard to accurately hit them with those long range weapons. And well, people seem pretty convinced that these long-range weapons are going to be the new meta anyway so might as well will use it to your advantage before the CL 40 gets nerfed.

Finally, rooftops also are pretty crippling against CL 40 users. I'm talking about roofs that are pointed, you know, they are like a pyramid. They fire in an arc. So if you just hide behind the top point of the pyramid, those grenades are either going to go over you entirely, or they're going to hit smack top of the roof, which is either going to do minimal damage to you or no damage at all depending on how far back away you are from the grenade. And that's depending on if the grenade is even hitting the very top of the roof or if it's hitting the other side of the roof from you. Again, long range weapons, even medium range weapons can deal with that just fine, assuming they don't try to jump pad into you, and that's still not a guarantee that you'll lose. Repositioning or pushing on if they're low is always a go to.

A lot of this advice can also go well against a group of cl40 users. I mean the last few games that gave me this information we all were using the CL40s and got our asses beat because of one or several of these. 

I really hope that what I've said can help you in playing against people that use the CL 40, and remember, the APS is a free shield. Dome shield too.

TL;DR: Keep calm, use shotguns or melee weapons with movement, or use long range weapons, try to keep the high ground and use pyramid-shaped roofs as a wall if you're both using high ground. Know when to reposition and prepare for jump pads, and always know the APS is there for you.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1fxb9b6/the_cl40_really_isnt_that_overpowered/,1728200351.0,-0.833,4104

How is the CL-40 the main balancing focus on this sub?,"TL;DR: The CL-40 is a mid weapon, isn't META, and won't be. The complaints about it feel blown out of proportion.

The fact that this is the fish that this sub is frying tells me the game is much more balanced than the general vibe of this sub would have you believe.

I play mostly WT and ranked cashout, I'm G3 right now, Diamond in s2, Emerald in s3, I don't know if that matters but heres more info to give you a frame of reference.

I don't even feel like we're playing the same game guys. I see more CL-40s in game now, but it's like, a couple of them. 3-4, and the teams aren't blowing lobbies out of the water. They're doing okay. Powershift I see it a lot, so what game mode are you guys playing to be struggling against the CL40?

I'm a Heavy main, the update most affected me, see bellow from the season 4 update patch notes;

>CL-40

>Increased max damage from 93 to 117

>Dev Note: This change sounds significant, but keeps the weapon in a place where it still takes two shots to kill a Light and three shots to kill a Medium. The change is mostly aimed at making a Heavy three shots to kill instead of four, as we felt it was unfair to the CL-40 to have to land all four of its available four shots (i.e. 100% accuracy) to kill a Heavy without reloading

>Decreased fire rate from 275 RPm to 210 RPM

>Dev Note: A small adjustment to offset the significant damage buff a little.

>Increased the max damage radius from 9cm to 30cm

Here's an updated spreadsheet comparing TTK, STK, across all classes and weapons;

This weapon has the slowest reload, slowest ROF, lowest mag count, requires even or high ground, and has a direct counter with APS. Dome shield stops %75 of a mag, mesh shield even more.

Double and triple stacking anything is annoying, the CL40 isn't even special in this regard, going against triple PIKE is way worse in S4, how is that not the main concern? I've seen that more than triple CL.

Literally all I need to do as a heavy is get high ground, or, if its a 1v1, shoot them to out DPS them. Anytime I've thrown down a dome shield while pushing a squad of 2 CL users, the shield breaks and they're already low health, we just shoot them and kill them. The only time I've lost was when they have high ground and the jump on us.

I don't even have a 3 stack yall, I'm mostly solo queuing right now, and when I do 3 stack, CL40 isn't even a thought in our mind.

There's so many tools to outplay, and direct counter them, these complaints feel disingenuous.

You don't even need to run APS to counter them if you don't want it, if you have a jump pad, jump and down while fighting them and you should have enough time to force a reload and beat them. If your a light player, dash, dash, dash, or Spiderman to high ground. If you're invis, yes, get fucked, the CL40 is directly countering your annoying, stupid, stun gun, invis, glitch, double barrel, sword, etc, that's been effective since the betas.

Say you literally do not want to run any specific thing to counter them, all you need is high ground, better aim, or positioning.

I didn't want to jump on the ""skill issue"" train, but dang guys, what else is there to say here?

The CL40 was even stronger in S1 and S2, yet people never complained then, so you know what I think is happening? It got buffed so people are trying it, and it turns out it's fun, so people are gonna use it for awhile, but they'll stop soon and go back to more consistent weapons. But if yall literally can't get figure out how to counter it, they'll just keep using it.

Lets talk nerfs that can be reverted,"Wanted to see peoples thoughts on some nerf reversions from some of the items in the game that have seen excessive nerfs:
Heavies
-rpg- now that it only does 100 damage, can we get some better accuracy while in motion, and can we remove the double self damage?
-dome shield- now that it has really low health, can we have the original time for deployment?
-mesh shield- now that it can’t be cycled and heal beam has been nerfed, maybe a touch more health?
-c4- now that nukes are long dead and gone, maybe an up to the damage or map destruction? Maybe go back to 2 charges?
-winch claw- give back the 15m range and extra 10 damage?

Medium
-magnum-slightly less visual recoil?
-cl40- remove the double self damage?

Light
-sniper- maybe this is a comment towards other guns, but why does the only long range weapon have severe bullet drop when the mid range weapons like lh1 and pike don’t?
-breach charge- same as heavy c4. This item needs some love because thermal bore is just a ranged version of this
-thermal vision- remove the tablet?
-glitch grenade- slightly longer explosion time? Help it keep up to glitch mine

General
-gas- it used to do a lot more damage. Considering pyro is so common and deletes gas, maybe revert some of the damage. It kind of does a worse job then fire now and just gets removed by fire. 
-health regens-heavy could use some love in the health regen department now that heal beam is aligned. Thinking either a quicker regen delay, or a minimum amount of damage needed to stop the healing? One measly uzi round doesn’t have to stop that healing after such a long delay.

"The Model 1887 has a useless feature, tell me why it's even there","Why does this weapon have a feature that is useless without another mechanic. I'm specifically talking about the fact that if you hold m1, it fires, then doesn't lever the gun, when you press reload while holding it the gun will lever, then lever again to catch the shell that's still in the gun. The only reason that feature should be there is if you can eject the shell then immediately begin reloading, otherwise it shouldn't exist unless theres some unknown mechanic with it that I don't know about.",176,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1gz9uj7/the_model_1887_has_a_useless_feature_tell_me_why/,1732506220.0,-0.0495,503
"The ""proper"" way to balance 1887?","Buff other weapons, especially AR. Just... change the recoil.

1887 didn't get any big balance change since S1, which shows it was at its balance. The reason why its pick rate skyrocketed and there are ppl who says it is op, is because other weapons are not so good compared to 1887 rn. More accurately, there isn't special merit to choose AR or other weapons, compared to 1887.

Also, considering 1887 requires the most basic and hard skill, proper aiming, someone who uses it well can dominate the game anyway with other weapons.

Then, what should be done? Nerf 1887? No. Like I said, 1887 didn't get any nerf or buff before, meaning it doesn't have to be touched.

Instead, change other weapons better, especially reducing or fixing strange visual recoil system of ARs, especially akm. Personally I feel damage is enough, the stupid recoil is the main problem.

I'm not gonna talk about non-standard weapons like dual blades, cl40 or shield, ofc... Although I agree melee weapons for medium is misdesigned, I think someone with bad aim skill shouldn't get the chance to dominate the game easily. (Yeah I am talking about cl40 spammers existed at the start of s4)",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1g9hc97/the_proper_way_to_balance_1887/,1729601401.0,-0.9874,1166
How to get better 🥲,"So I’ve been playing The Finals since the end of s2. This is the first fps game I ever played. And my aim is sh** lol. I’ve been playing heavy flamethrower for s3 and s4 because I don’t really need to aim and I’ve been able to play some pretty decent matches.

However, I would very much want to be able to play something else. I practice a lot in powershift with different guns, but it seems like I’m just wasting my time (and frustrating some of my teammates sorry lol).

Do you guys have any tips or things to try to have a better aim and get better at the game? Thanks!! ",26,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1geylmg/how_to_get_better/,1730218808.0,0.9431,575
People hate the cl-40 because it doesn't let you react sometimes,"People do not hate the cl40, atleast I don't, because they hate the gun, they hate it because it melts all classes and is really easy to use. I think they overturned it with one simple change, that being the damage radius. I want the weapon to be good, but I think it needs some changes for fairness sake. I'm not saying I know the solution, I'm no game dev, you cannot deny changes because you believe it will nerf it to the ground. The solution is not to let it be overpowered in the eyes of many or make it underpowered. The solution should be to balance it. If we have to beg Embark to keep changing it to be balanced, then that is better than letting it be a problem, and this goes for anything like the now dead dome shield. Don't get mad at people because they are stifling your fun by wanting a weapon or mechanic to stop ruining their fun. In short, don't be an ass and I believe that the cl40 cpuld probably use a rebalance. A minor change with nothing huge that will ruin it, not a nerf but a rebalance.",13,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1ftff7q/people_hate_the_cl40_because_it_doesnt_let_you/,1727755863.0,0.8853,1014

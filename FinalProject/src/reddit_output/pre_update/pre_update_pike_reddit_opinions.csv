Pike 556 nerfed too much ,Anyone else feel like nerfing the dmg of the pike is too much? Going from a 3 shot to a 4 shot on lights has ruined the gun imo and I no longer find it viable.,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1gp286i/pike_556_nerfed_too_much/,1731356839.0,-0.6369,159
"What do you think of the Pike 556? I like it a lot myself, I mainly use the Iron sights for it, I think it works the best and it looks the cleanest, also I wish that the fire rate was a bit faster IMO (I know it will probably be nerfed soon tho)",,7,https://i.redd.it/bhehgqr6terd1.png,1727468664.0,0.0,0
"I can't believe they nerfed the pike 556, it was so satisfying hard countering lights with it. they couldnt even give it a small buff to offset the nerf like reload speed or something.",I guess if lights keep complaining loud enough the devs will nerf anything that stops them from being able to dash around uncontested.

Which weapon do you like more: LH1 or Pike .556?,"For me, I like the LH1 a lot more and I think it is better than the Pike .556 for several reasons:

1. Faster fire rate
2. Higher headshot damage
3. Generally better TTK across all classes

(I like playing light class)

Also, I think the scope makes the LH1 a lot better

Pike bug? Bullets fly way to high,"I just played a game with the Pike 556 and whenever I would scope in, my bullets went way high. I wasn't able to hit anything. Confirmed by shooting a wall as well. The bullets hit where the crosshair ends up after the recoil animation goes through, right before the crosshair centers again. 

Restarted the game and played a new match and the same thing happened.

I play mouse and keyboard. Other weapons with scope didn't have the issue. I tried the sniper for example and it worked as expected.

Season 4: A Critical Review,"I decided to make this post now that the hype of Season 4 has settled, to share my harsh opinion about this update and provide neutral feedback to the devs. Reading the patch notes, I can't help but feel a bittersweet mix of disappointment and joy. Maybe it’s because I was hoping for a significant change of pace, but this 4.0.0 patch feels more like a QoL update than a proper Season refresh. There’s a lack of substantial changes that really shake things up. I’ll summarize my thoughts in a table below. Everything I don’t mention here, I consider to be a positive change, but it’s the missed opportunities that stand out to me.

|Change|Review - Opinion|Suggestions|
|:-|:-|:-|
|.50 Akimbo|Weapon look cool but can suddenly become inaccurate and perform poorly at close range. I’m not sure if it’s due to the animations, pacing, movement penalties, server issues, my aim (either missing every shot or killing enemies instantly), or something else, but they tend to feel either insanely good or frustratingly bad.|Not sure. Needs a QoL change, not a nerf.|
|Pike-556|Needs more testing. My main issue with this weapon is its purpose; it just doesn't fit within the Medium class. Pike enjoyers give us your feedback please.|Give it to the Light class with a firerate or damage reduction.|
|M26 Matter|It feels strong. I'm not sure if we needed another shotgun in the game to be honest.|Give it to the Heavy class. I don’t understand why Embark insists on giving shotguns to the only class capable of effectively closing the gap between enemies, effectively eliminating the inherent disadvantages of shotguns.|
|SH1900|Same as above, Light shouldn't have shotguns. This is why Season 1 was a nightmare, with players running around using Cloak and the SH1900. It led to a hard nerf to the Cloaking Device, which still feels bad to use even today.||
|Alternate Sights & Scopes|Good feature, but mid nonetheless—maybe because it's new (let them cook). Also, I don’t like having to create multiple loadouts to use the same weapon with different sights & scopes.|Allow me to switch them at the start of a round or during mid-game. Add more options like hybrid red dot, triangle, thermal, theres a lot of good examples online etc.|
|Anti-Gravity Cube|A minor increase in radius and height will never make this gadget meta. It needs a major buff; otherwise, it will always be stuck in the realm of being useless or situational. This is a pointless 'buff'. Change my mind.|1.-Add a glitch effect to players within its area of effect that persist for a couple of seconds after getting out.                     2.-Lift things faster.                  3.- If it gets destroyed before it ends reduce its cooldown.         4.-Can be activated – deactivated remotely over its duration, with a control similar to the C4|
|Breach Charge|Lacks synergy with the Light class, which is built around agility, speed, and fast engagements. Light specializes in flanking, scouting, and mobility—not destruction. The gadget takes time to set up and detonate, and isn't as effective as C4. It also doesn't compete with other options that enhance the fast-paced, mobile playstyle of the Light class.|Remove the gadget from the class. Give it to the Heavy class as passive.|
|Thermal Bore (had no changes but was mentioned)|The Thermal Bore doesn’t fit well with the Light class. While it’s a support gadget, the high mobility of the Light class means they don’t benefit from it as much as the Heavy class would. Since Lights don’t really need it, they are unlikely to pick it, leaving the Heavy on their team without crucial support, especially in map variants like Suspended Structures. It also synergizes better with the Heavy’s focus on destruction.|Switch this gadget to Heavy.|
|Data Reshaper|The gadget feels underwhelming. Its function is too niche or situational. Even if this gadget gets five charges, I still can’t justify picking it over more versatile or impactful gadgets. I could just shoot the utility instead of risking getting closer to reshape. It often feels like a wasted slot in many situations.|**REWORK:** Now creates a small radius around the player, within which any enemy deployed equipment and gadgets that come into contact are reshaped. This effect lasts 5 seconds, allowing for both offensive and defensive strategies.|
|Flashbang|This gadget is underused and offers little real value in the chaotic nature of the game. \*\*|Completely remove the Blind status effect for teammates and yourself. Add a visual indicator above the heads of affected enemies.|
|Proximity Sensor|This gadget doesn’t fit with Heavy’s role|Switch this gadget to Medium.|
|RPG||Reduce self-damage from splash damage to match the damage dealt to enemies (100). The increased reload time is unnecessary; please revert it or, at the very least, reduce it because it feels bad.|
|Dematerializer|**BUG FIX:** Sometimes it doesn’t allow you to completely close what you’ve opened.||
|Spear|The Sledgehammer outshines the Spear because it better aligns with the heavy-hitting, slow-but-powerful playstyle expected from the Heavy class. However, the alternate attack feels too slow and can't be canceled in time, leaving you vulnerable by locking you into an animation.|Increase its effective range of your primary attacks and increase your movement speed while holding the spear, at the very least increase the attack speed.|
|SR-84 Sniper|It doesn’t belong in this game. It’s frustrating to play against and to have on your team, **regardless of the game mode**, and it encourages a TDM/free-for-all mentality in a team-based, objective-oriented environment. It can also be exploited by using it as a shotgun.|Remove it.|
|New Map|The map is fine overall, but it annoys me that it doesn't have a unique design like the others. The same layouts from other maps are reused, and in several sections, the design becomes unnecessarily complicated, adding rooms in places where they shouldn't be.||
|No new specializations or gadgets|It’s possible they were preoccupied with the sponsor system that they forgot or didnt had time to add these, which is disappointing. I was hoping for a rework of the Turret to provide healing instead, the introduction of healing darts or healing grenades, and other ideas.||

>^(\*\* Introduce a dedicated loadout slot specifically for grenades. This would allow players to customize their loadouts more effectively, ensuring throwable grenades are always available and making them more relevant in gameplay. Only specific grenades—such as Flashbang, Pyro, Gas, Smoke, Frag, and Goo—would occupy this slot, this will also push the knowledge about how certain grenades counter each other.)

The DEV NOTE about the Heavy Archetype infuriates me... A LOT. And here's exactly why:

1. The claim that the Heavy is ""by far the most winning"" while also being the ""least played"" is contradictory and raises questions about the balancing logic, which seems to favor feedback from top-scrim players only (which is a completetly different enviroment)
2. There is no context regarding the win rates. For example:
   * The Heavy may be more effective in team play, given its intended role as a defensive, high-destruction class, while many players are more focused on fragging in most games.
   * Other teams may have performed better overall but experienced bad luck in crucial moments, which happens frequently in this game.
   * Why is the Light class considered more fun? Its low time-to-kill (TTK) and high mobility are advantages that the Heavy completely lacks.
   * Additionally, a lack of communication between random teammates in your teams could lead to a TDM mentality, ultimately impacting win rates.

*^(In my opinion, these factors do not warrant hard nerfs because they compromise the Heavy class's identity and its fun factor, which is the opposite of what they claim they want to achieve.)*

1. Many players feel that the Heavy class has become high-risk, low-reward, and is no longer fun to play due to continuous nerfs to the same mechanics that once enhanced its enjoyment and role, as well as its overall clunkiness. If the developers are addressing this, it’s because this feedback is widespread.
2. The statement about ""making it more balanced in terms of power and making it more fun to play"" is vague. There are no clear explanations or specific changes proposed to achieve this balance. In fact, they did nothing to reflect this in the ""seasonal update,"" and the only positive changes felt more like reversals of unfair nerfs rather than genuine improvements aimed at enhancing fun.
3. The Heavy class is slow, lacks mobility gadgets, takes longer to reload, and has a large hitbox. This clearly indicates that the primary source of enjoyment comes from explosive damage affecting others and its defensive capabilities. If you take those away, gameplay becomes stale, which will definitely hurt pick rates. I don’t even want to start thinking about solo players. I really don’t think this is a smart direction for balance.
4. The statement implies that balancing efforts are primarily based on statistical analysis rather than player experiences, directly suggesting that players subjective feedback on gameplay and enjoyment is being overlooked. Which reflects on the patch notes.

Artificially weakening a class to compensate for the inherent weaknesses of others is fundamentally unfair. The balance between Heavy and Medium versus Light isn't just about stats on paper; it’s about how they perform in real gameplay, which is rooted in experience, not just raw numbers. I'm addressing fundamental aspects of game balance. The Light class is designed to be a high-speed, high-DPS role with low HP—this is simply how the devs intended to structure its archetype. A healthier approach might have been to make the Light a combat medic type, but they didn’t go that route. By choosing to play Light, you accept the trade-off of having low HP and the inherent disadvantages that come with it—Glass Cannon 101, you can't have your cake and eat it too... It’s clear to anyone paying attention that the skill curve of Light is dropping, making it low-risk and high-reward, and the current balance undermines the intended uniqueness and effectiveness of the Heavy class.

Claiming that Light is weak due to its low HP is akin to saying Heavy is weak because it’s slower and has a large hitbox. The issues with the triple Healing Beam or Mesh Shield being annoying are separate matters that I discussed in another post, and they relate to the lack of diminishing returns in-game. Allowing multiple players on the same team to use the same specialization has triggered a significant wave of nerfs to Heavy and Medium since Season 1 (especially because these specializations are to protect or help teammates, but the Light specializations are selfish), and these nerfs continue to this day. Simply nerfing the Heavy class doesn’t address the root cause of these problems.

Severe visual recoil when shot with high firerate weapons?,"Lately I've noticed that when I'm being shot with certain weapons, I receive a significant amount of purely visual recoil that often makes it honestly difficult to respond by shooting back.  These guns are at least primarily the XP54, the M11, and the AKM.

While it is purely visual, the severity to which it makes my gun jump can make it rather difficult to fight back despite me being able to technically win the fight on paper.  Especially when using something like the Pike 556 with the scope, it can often be outright disorienting to try to aim down sights while under fire by these weapons.  Something like a computer monitor with a built in crosshair feature could in theory help alleviate this, but having to replace hardware to deal with the matter seems against the spirit of things. 

I wanted to ask what other people think about this visual recoil, whether its something they've never noticed or whether they dislike it or what have you.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1fydpzg/severe_visual_recoil_when_shot_with_high_firerate/,1728323026.0,-0.4404,951

Hot take I guess? PIKE isn’t OP.,"The pike isn’t really THAT good. It’s strong yes, but OP? I’m not seeing it.

I’m seeing so much complaining about it and I’m not understanding. A DMR hits hard…?

It has a slow fire rate, low capacity, meh hip fire, and high damage. I don’t see how you can nerf it without making it bad. It’s just another one of those weapons where balancing it is a nightmare. It’s either gonna be really good or really bad.

Season 4 has only been out for 1 day. Can we give it some time before we start calling for nerfs on a weapon that hasn’t even settled in yet? ",135,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1fqkgff/hot_take_i_guess_pike_isnt_op/,1727432441.0,-0.758,554
We need to talk about the Pike and the Medium meta we're in right now,"The ttk of this weapon is already one of the best amongst the Medium's arsenal, but coupled with the fire rate, mag size, hipfire accuracy, and near lack of recoil; it blows out not just everything on Medium, but everything else in the game.

You can view the data yourself using these 3 sources:

* [spreadsheet with ttk values across all weapons](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1Ud7Rdl3AgMw9mmfDwW2LtDMnzZQ9IIhnqSE4ivsaMTs/htmlview)
* [great video by Appoh going more in-depth on what makes the Pike so strong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B7h0zSFrX8)
* [practice range of all the new weapons that also shows the recoil pattern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjD6YbKJEiY)

For those of you who were here early season 1; I'm sure you can agree that this feels just as, if not more, oppressive than FCAR + Recon Sense Mediums. And far worse than Model 1887 spam the 2nd half of last season.

I'm seeing post after post after post of screenshots of all Medium lobbies, and seeing little to no Heavys in my games. But the lack of Heavy representation requires its own post. However, it must be pointed out that the inclusion of the Pike and the CL-40 buff are not the only things factoring into this. The nerf, and subsequent absence, of Mesh Shield has left a void in the meta that makes way for players to run at teams with blind abandon and come out on top more often than not.

I know there is a vocal majority that's okay with the state of the game (and the state of the Pike), but you have to take it with a grain of salt when the majority of the playerbase only plays 2-3 hrs a week with an emphasis on the casual game modes. Someone with 400+ hrs in the game with that time primarily in the competitive modes is going to inherently have a better understanding of the game than someone with <100 hrs. The game should not be balanced around the casual modes; it is a competitive, objective-based shooter with casual modes.

Listening to the vocal majority, casual players, is how we ended up with the removal of team wipes in World Tour / Cashout Tournament last season; which you immediately re-instated. Or how we got a Sniper nerf; a weapon not strong by any metric outside of Power Shift and sometimes Terminal Attack. Sniper wasn’t the problem with Power Shift; it was long-range, uncontestable dmg which the Pike and LH1 have filled in those game modes.

* [patch notes where you cover the breakdown of the playerbase](https://www.reachthefinals.com/patchnotes/cashoutblog)

I know this is an unpopular opinion, but the game is experiencing the worst balance period since early season 1 and it will only get worse as more people play Medium to combat Medium because they’ll feel they have no other options.

**tl;dr:** The nerf to Heavy and the buffs to Medium + Inclusion of the Pike have resulted in an overwhelmingly oppressive Medium meta

For context: I've been playing since Open Beta 1, have 800+ hrs in the game, and was Emerald 3 (almost 2) last season

Seeing a constant stream of ""nerf pike it's op"" with zero reasoning or thought is a major fucking drag. It's not constructive or helpful at all. Just a constant drip feed of ""nerf pike"" spam.

As it stands, the gun does 59 dmg on body, and around 88 on head. This feels like a reasonable amount. It 2 taps a Light with headshots, 3 taps a Medium with headshots, and 4 taps a Heavy. If it shifts any lower the gun becomes basically totally non-viable against Heavy(/Medium ish).

Famas is my 3rd fav medium gun behind 1887 and CL40, so I've got some decent experience on it.  In hip fire, the accuracy is insane and does crazy burst damage.  Now, with the new scope, it shreds even more at range and getting easier headshots.  Famas is truly an all arounder.

The problem with the Pike (and other weapons). ,"I think most semi automatic weapons are really difficult to use when playing on console just because the advantage mouse has aiming. It's like these weapons are designed to be used exclusively with MnK. This is really evident with the Pike, light pistol, and especially the sword. Almost every light with sword or medium with pike I see destroying a lobby is on pc. Using sword with mouse you can turn incredibly fast and be perfectly accurate. And using semi auto guns is easier with mouse, because every shot counts, unlike ARs that you can miss a couple of shots and still win the fight. I know a lot of people here like to think that AA in controller is like aimbotting, but it really isn't. I'm a Medium/Light main btw.

It just doesn't feel like a different option, other than the heavy vertical recoil and harder-to-adapt-to pattern making it worse in general.

That said, here's what I'd like to propose:

----

I made a data set comparison between the FCAR I'd like to see and the current FCAR.

-

Current FCAR:

22dmg

577rpm

24rnd mag

2.0s reload

212 DPS

-

Light = 7 body (0.624s TTK) 5 head (0.52s TTK)

Medium = 12 body (1.144s TTK) 8 head (0.728s TTK)

Heavy = 16 body (1.664s TTK) 11 head (1.04s TTK)

---------------------

Modified FCAR:

-

35dmg

340rpm

20rnd mag

2.0s reload

198 DPS

-

Light = 5 body (0.706s TTK) 3 head (0.53s TTK)

Medium = 8 body (1.235s TTK) 5 head (0.706s TTK)

Heavy = 10 body (1.588s TTK) 7 head (1.059s TTK)

----

Now yes, on paper it LOOKS more similar to the V9S at first glance than it's designed to function.

The V9S is specifically built for close ranges, and my FCAR rework stats are based around keeping the current reload speed and terrible recoil pattern.

The V9S has a significantly faster fire rate at 425 RPM, a LIGHTNING fast 1.3s reload speed, better hip fire accuracy, and a near-perfectly vertical recoil pattern (seriously it's legit the easiest pattern to memorize in the game, virtually a straight line up).

It could be the same 37dmg model as the V9S on Light, but I kinda like the idea of the gun being a bit less effective against Medium/Heavy to offset the V9S comparison in closer quarters combat and give the V9S just that much more of an edge up on the FCAR in CQC).

Can we talk about the new nade launcher?,"I just wanna see the logic behind it is all. So, a 45 second cooldown RPG now deals 100dmg. The CL40 has been buffed to 117dmg per grenade, and the radius you can achieve max damage with each grenade has been more than tripled. They are both impact splash damage weapons, albeit one as a gadget thus the 45s cooldown. But what this has equated to is a LOT of heavys aren't even using RPG anymore, and we now have a 4 round RPG launcher in the medium class with less environmental destruction (which is a good thing if you don't want the floor of your target disappearing). The reload is still remarkably fast so there's not much punishment on that end, I just wanna know what yall think their logic was in nerfing most explosives this season but buffing the noob tube?",8,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1fqyepe/can_we_talk_about_the_new_nade_launcher/,1727471905.0,-0.4808,768
"Now that weapons have attachments, what if the launchers had attachments?","CL 40 Gas, with no explosive damage, all damage is direct impact and gas.

MGL Fire grenades 

Flamethrower that sprays gas instead of fire

Things like that? The only hesitation i have is the gas ones because I actually feel like I have no idea how strong or weak gas is because most of the time people just step away, or there's so much fire that it all evaporates.

Another idea i got from this is a fire extinguisher gadget that works like Flamethrower but with smoke coming out. 

Or even CL40 smoke. Same as gas, but more utility based, I guess.

Just kind of spitballing ideas at this point lol, I just feel like gas and smoke are kind of under utilized and so is the MGL.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1fxp2cu/now_that_weapons_have_attachments_what_if_the/,1728243996.0,0.1655,679
Why doesn't my CL 40 do splash damage? ,"I thought that was the point of a grenade launcher. 

I really want a list of the players that 3 stacked the CL40 and caused this nerf.

The way I've been tryna figure out why my gun isn't slashing just to see the patch notes breaks my soul. ",321,https://i.redd.it/6qcldairlh4e1.png,1733167821.0,0.0018,242
Embark officially made the WT unplayable with new patch,"**Before you downvote**, let me tell you that I only play heavy and light. And right now, all these suspended structures and moving platforms are SCREAMING medium. I don't have enough mobility to steal cashout on both suspended structures and moving platforms using heavy. And since there are at least 30-40% more people playing medium, we started seeing more 3 turret gameplays, CLs, models or teams that only focus on third partying. So light is literally insta death too. 

Couple ways to manage this;  
\-Using teleport with light (insta death still applies even with taking great position because of 3 turret players...)  
\-Highly depend on your teammate for mobility (random chance if you're a solo player)  
\-Use off-meta gadgets to counter these meta players whom are way too often now

And so on.

I just don't want to be forced to change my playstyle. I have way less chance to win the games with my favorite Flamethrower heavy loadout now. And this shouldn't be possible in a fair game. I know some weapons will be stronger in some maps etc. But making the entire game mode only focused on Suspended Structures and Moving Platforms? Why? To promote their new ""map skins"". And where were you when you released Fortune embark? People got Fortune 1 out of 10 maybe 15 games. Why didn't you promote it better? 

Lets stay on the topic. Removing Fortune and Syss horizon while adding ranged-weapon-dependant maps forced players to play medium or ranged weapons, and forced players like me to change their entire playstyle or lose the game.

I don't know a single person that likes ""to play"" in Kyoto. Map is beautiful, but playing is painful.  
Same can be said to Monaco Suspended Structures.  
And same can be said to Seoul Moving Platforms.

And they are all in the same map pool right now.

Maybe this is intentional to force some players to play ranked more? idk. What do you think about all of this?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1gwkm51/embark_officially_made_the_wt_unplayable_with_new/,1732209530.0,0.8233,1913
Considerations for MGL32 rework…,"As some YouTubers have pointed out, and with personal experience, the MGL is actually a pretty powerful weapon. It’s just particularly difficult to use.

The CL40 buff at the beginning of season 4 demonstrated that the community absolutely hates prevalent use of a grenade launcher.

That being said, the potential MGL rework absolutely cannot afford to make it easy to use, otherwise it’ll get nerfed into irrelevance.

I really don’t think it needs a change. However, I suspect the reason Embark wants to change it is because currently it is almost useless at very close range, whereas Heavy seems to be intended to play close range. I’ve seen a lot of terrible suggestions for this weapon, such as being able to cycle through explosion types (gas, fire etc). 

~~But, if it must be done, I think the change is very simple; make grenades explode on impact with players. That’s it. Keep all other existing mechanics.~~

Edit: new proportion thanks to u/Grand_Neck8781

Keep all existing mechanics the same, however grenades deal x (75 or so) amount of impact damage on direct hits, but still bounce off players. This could cause some REALLY cool combos where you bounce a grenade off a player onto a nearby surface and do more damage.

I’ve also thought about the idea of the reload being one at a time if there are 4 or more grenades in the cylinder, and then a full reload if there are less, or something like that. I think the variable reload speeds in this game are interesting and can lead to some cool strategies. 

Let me know your thoughts!",8,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1gow9fp/considerations_for_mgl32_rework/,1731342565.0,0.8214,1549

Need advice with the Heavy grenade launcher.,"I'd like to get semi good with it, even though it's one if the heavies less viable weapons, I'm just sick of using the melee build I have and want to try something new.

So far the way I've been grazing kills was by launching them into dence areas and hoping for the best and I've noticed that it kinda sucks in open spaces, or at least I'm may be using it wrong. 

Usually if I was fighting somebody I would aim at the wall since it bounces first and then blows up, but if say a tiny mosquito light has a sword, theres not much I can do, and shooting at my feet usually just gets me killed.

The load out I use is googrenades, explosive mine and RPG with charge N slam.

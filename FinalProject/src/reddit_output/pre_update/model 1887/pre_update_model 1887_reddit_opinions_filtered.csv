Model 1887 Is Not OP and does not need a nerf.,Been seeing to many nerf 1887 post so just wanna make mine too. The gun is good at close range and a good counter to light players and has too mny disadvantage from bad at distance to slowest reload any nerf will make it unusable.its in a perfect spot,678,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1g8mw8n/model_1887_is_not_op_and_does_not_need_a_nerf/,1729508308.0,0.2023,251
Why do so many people hate the Model 1887 all of a sudden?,"This gun has remained unchanged since S1 and just now I'm seeing so many people complain about it here and on the official Discord.

Main complaint I see people make, is that the Model deals too much damage at range and they will get half their HP deleted from across the map. The only 2 ways I see this happening are: they get shot multiple times from afar and don't do anything (I have seen so many people do this) OR they consider 20 meters to be across the map. Because at longer rages, the Model basically just peppers people and it only has 6 shots that you shouldn't waste on a heavy on the other side of the map

  
Another very common complaint is that a skilled Model player is very frustrating to play against. But that is the case for all weapons, someone who is very good at using a certain gun is going to be very annoying to play against, A good sword dash light is almost impossible to hit and can wipe a team if they're too close from each other, a heavy that is good with MGL32 can deal some crazy chip damage from a far, etc.

I think people are now just complaining about the Model because the AK and the FCAR got nerfed. 

So what we nerf every decent weapon until we they are all trash?

"The Model 1887 has a useless feature, tell me why it's even there","Why does this weapon have a feature that is useless without another mechanic. I'm specifically talking about the fact that if you hold m1, it fires, then doesn't lever the gun, when you press reload while holding it the gun will lever, then lever again to catch the shell that's still in the gun. The only reason that feature should be there is if you can eject the shell then immediately begin reloading, otherwise it shouldn't exist unless theres some unknown mechanic with it that I don't know about.",175,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1gz9uj7/the_model_1887_has_a_useless_feature_tell_me_why/,1732506220.0,-0.0495,503
The model 1887 should get a range nerf and no just because it takes skill to use doesn't mean it should be left unchanged.,I've seen this argument thrown around that because some player struggle with the model or because they can't just stay out in the open at 20m and beat an ak user means it should stay the same. If you peak in and out of cover you can outgun ar users at ranges you should not be able to which is stronger for a gun that has no hipfire accuracy drawbacks and deals massive bursts of damage. I think a moderate range nerf is 100% justifiable for the pike to bring some relevancy back to ars and is a much better alternative than buffing ars back to fcar meta status.,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1ga5lp9/the_model_1887_should_get_a_range_nerf_and_no/,1729672265.0,-0.7561,562

"Please nerf Model 1887 Embark, Please, just a little bit.","I've been saying for 2 Seasons that Model 1887 deals too much damage. It deals 128 damage to anyone from Heavies to Lights at around 10 meters range. Why is that a problem? 3 Medium stacks. The weakness of a 3 M stack is close range combat, since fighting at Medium to Long range they can negate damage via Healbeam, and safely revive/Defib. The Model 1887 is the Strongest close range shotgun in THE FINALS, negating the weakness of 3 M stacks.

The closest contender is the SH1900 which deals 180 at around 5 meters range, but it is wielded by Lights, which are a 1 shot Quick Melee Kill to the Model 1887. The Heavy's SA1216 on the other Hand CAN deal 91 damage per shot at around 3 meters range, but since you're a Heavy Big Boy, you'll never catch anyone in that range and the reason I said CAN is because the SA1216 has some pretty large spread. The SH1900 also has pretty wide spread making it deal a lot less damage the further out you go. The Model 1887's spread is tiny in comparison, meaning more pellets hit, meaning more damage and at more range.

I have actually tested the Shots needed to kill each Class by each of the shotguns at 1 meter, 6 meters and 10 meters, and found that the Model 1887 has the same amount of shots needed to kill for all these ranges, 2 shots or 1 shot and a Quick Melee for Lights, 2 shots for Mediums and 3 shots for Heavies. Additionally it can deal fairly reliable damage up to 20 meters, killing Lights in 3 shots, Mediums in 5 shots and Heavies in 7 shots. Meanwhile SH1900 and SA1216 fall off in the 5-10 meter range already, and barely tickle at 15-20 meters. \[I can put the actual results in a Spreadsheet if you wanna see\]

The Model 1887 also deals the highest damage per shot in the game, excluding SR-84 Headshots and Bow Headshots which are special cases, since it's Headshots, a few Melee Weapons like Dagger Backstab, Sword Lunge and Hammer Heavy attack, but any and all Melee weapons get bodied by the far higher range of the Model 1887.

Model 1887 being the longest range shotgun is honestly fine in my opinion, but it just deals to much damage. Nerfing that damage to at most 108 per shot would be perfect IMO since it won't hit the breakpoint where it can 1 shot Quick Melee Lights, 2 shot Mediums and 3 shot Heavies and instead 2 shot Lights, 2 shot Quick Melee Mediums and 4 shot Heavies, which would feel a lot better to play against.

TL;DR Model 1887 stomps any and all other weapons and makes 3M too strong, please nerf.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1gtrbfm/please_nerf_model_1887_embark_please_just_a/,1731887523.0,-0.9908,2490
Model 1887 is META,"Let’s talk about the **Model 1887**, the most broken weapon in the game right now. How the hell is a shotgun dealing **100 to 120 damage** from over **20 meters away**? Shotguns are supposed to be close-range powerhouses, not some sniper with a spread as wide as a damn **RPG**! This gun is completely unbalanced. No other weapon in the game comes close to its ridiculous range and damage. It’s like carrying an RPG with shotgun shells—it’s absurd!

And let’s not forget the players who defend this overpowered mess. They’ve been abusing it for months, terrified that if it gets nerfed, their ""skills"" will disappear overnight. Well, guess what? **They will**! Because the truth is, these players have been carried by this broken gun, and the second it’s balanced, they’ll be **done**. No more easy kills from across the map with a shotgun that hits harder than an RPG.

These people are out here acting like psychics, predicting every move, but in reality, the **Model 1887** is doing all the work for them. They know it’s unfair, but they cling to it because they can’t compete without it. Let’s be honest: if you need a shotgun that snipes, you’re not as good as you think you are.

The devs need to **nerf this thing into the ground**. It doesn’t belong in the game, and anyone who says it’s balanced is just scared they won’t be able to keep up once this crutch is gone. Enough is enough—get rid of it!",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1g31yys/model_1887_is_meta/,1728859744.0,-0.9785,1407
nerf complain model 1887,"(i added a clip for an example of what they did to the model 1887)  
  
wellp here is my complain

so i saw another patch update and to my surprise i saw that the model 1887 was nerfed.... ofcourse it gets nerfed mainly because more people started using it and many people complained about it. i have tried out the shotgun after the nerf and man it actually sucks, like i can't do anything at all while a light from 200m is able to laser me with a smg.

the shotgun had allready a few problems that kept it balanced imo like:  
1. 6 ammo  
2. very slow reload  
3. very low damage from very long distance like around 16 iirc  
4. you get punished hard for missing your shots  
5. fire rate is not even that fast

  
i have noticed the finals loves to nerf either medium or heavy all the time while light keeps getting a buff. i honestly don't see the reason for the model 1887 nerf but i do get it why many people started using it. maybe if the game didn't nerf reliable weapons for medium like AK or FCAR to the ground then people wouldn't have switched to the model 1887. 

i know im ranting alot about this nerf but i have litteraly been playing model 1887 sinse open beta and no one ever complained about the weapon being like too OP or whatever but sinse the last couple weeks because more people started using it it's suddenly game breaking? i honestly don't even feel like touching this game anymore because i know that another weapon is gonna get nerfed to the ground because many people start maining it.

wellp that was my rant about the finals and i most likely will never touch this game ever again unless some good fixes are made.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1gfs7ty/nerf_complain_model_1887/,1730309506.0,0.6568,1643

Hot Take: The Finals is balanced very well and Embark doesn't need to nerf anything right now.,"People ask for nerfs way too much here. There's always something that people laser-focus complain about in this subreddit, then once it's nerfed, they just move onto the next thing. Most of the time, this community isn't even talking about the most imbalanced thing at the time.

Perfect example: the model 1887. This is the current focus of balancing discussions here. This weapon hasn't been touched since launch and has been powerful the entire time, it still gets beat at range by every ranged weapon, and is a skill cannon. You need to learn the reload and land your shots or the TTK skyrockets. Can anyone pick this weapon up and dominate a lobby? No. It's not OP.

Is this game perfectly balanced? No. Is it as bad as some people act? Not even close.


Edit: I just want to clarify, a lot of things have been nerfed, especially heavy.

*There needs to be more focus on buffs.*

I've explained in a couple of comments, one linked below, but to keep it short, I think buffing H defensive options and giving glitch mines to H would indirectly fix a lot of things. Team comp balance would be better, H would be picked more and better fill the niche it's supposed to fill. Defensive H's would challenge L and M in close range more. Less M and L in lobbies would mean 1887 is less effective without nerfing it. Giving H glitch mines fit with the defensive fortress playstyle of H and directly counter M. That just makes sense to me.

Model 1887 appreciation post,"I love shotguns. I think they’re way more fun/interesting than ARs. But it usually seems they’re an afterthought in most games and reduced to a niche pick. Overpowered at close range, useless anywhere else, ultimately causing automatic weapons to be the most effective choice overall, leaving shotgun enjoyers everywhere to suffer.

But not with the Model 1887. The standard of strength and power that all weapons are held to. Seemingly a source of controversy as of late, as many call for a nerf on its range particularly- the very thing that makes this shotgun so uniquely effective.

I’m not saying it deserves to be overpowered, and I don’t think it is. I think it’s effective, and I appreciate that.

Just had to get that off my chest. If anyone else feels the need to share a memory they’ve made with this masterpiece, please comment below.",7,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1g4geix/model_1887_appreciation_post/,1729021201.0,0.9797,846
A question about the model 1887,"I am trying to improve myself with  different weapons and in the last couple of days i have been using the model 1887. I am not sure if it's a bug or if that's how it works but, when i start reloading, i cannot shoot. During the fight, i do a lot of covering and reloading, and most of the times when i come out to shoot, it simply doesn't. It's  not consistent as well, sometimes it shoots right away after the click, sometimes it takes 5-6 clicks.

Is this a bug? 
If not what am i doin wrong?

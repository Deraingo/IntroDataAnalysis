The heal beam, a tool in the medium class arsenal, has seen a decrease in use following the season 4 nerf.

The game also encourages individual play styles, with the player preferring to stay alive as long as possible and using various tools like the goo grenade and dematerializer to achieve this. The player also sees the value in dealing damage and supporting the team, even if they can't always finish an opponent off.

"The reviewer expresses a strong belief that the game 'The Finals' is not doing as poorly as some players suggest. They mention several criticisms, including subpar quality, poor balancing, rampant cheating, and bad monetization, but they argue that these issues are either exaggerated or common to all FPS games. 

The quality of the game is praised, especially given the smaller size of the development team compared to a major AAA studio. The reviewer appreciates the developers' ongoing efforts to balance the game. They state that the developers are listening to player feedback and making changes accordingly, even if they can't satisfy every individual player's preferences. 

On the issue of cheating, the reviewer acknowledges its existence but argues that 'The Finals' is doing a better job of handling it than other games. They claim that three out of five times they report a cheater, they receive confirmation of the cheater's banning within a week. They contrast this with other games like Apex Legends, where reported cheaters often go unpunished.

The user praises the game's monetization strategy, highlighting that it allows players to buy individual items from a bundle and the opportunity to earn 27 free rewards during the current Halloween event. These rewards are not just stickers or charms, but quality skins. This is contrasted positively with another game, Apex's collection event. 

However, the user suggests that 'The Finals' is not performing as well as it could because players are unwilling to abandon the skill they've acquired in other games to start afresh, even if 'The Finals' is superior in every aspect. This reluctance is attributed to the competitive culture and a desire to be a successful streamer or esports athlete. 

For 'The Finals' to achieve success, the user suggests that one of the 'big four' games (Apex, Fortnite, Call of Duty, or Overwatch) which have similar gameplay, would need to fail. They recommend that Embark (presumably the developers of 'The Finals') ensures the game is in a great state to capitalize on any potential failings of these big four games.

The frag grenade is highly favored due to its damage and the element of surprise it brings, as there is no grenade indicator in the game. It has been rated as an A-tier pick. The smoke grenade has been termed as a niche pick due to its limited usage, but the reviewer hopes for a future buff which would make the game more interesting. It is currently placed in the C-tier. 

The flashbang has seen improvements in this season, making it more usable than before. It now only gives hit indicators if someone is fully blinded and the blind effect lasts longer. This places them in the B-tier. The gas grenade is in a strange spot, being decent for delaying cash outs or doing crowd control damage, but it’s difficult to capitalize off it and some players can heal through the damage. It is also placed in the C-tier. 

The ponade gadget wasn't discussed in detail, and its tier rating wasn't mentioned. The reviewer suggested that a longer duration for gas grenades or giving the player two of them might encourage more use in higher level lobbies. 

Overall, the reviewer seems to appreciate the changes made by the 4.2.0 update but suggests some The user provides detailed opinions on several weapons and gadgets in 'The Finals' game after the 4.2.0 update. 

The Cl40 is viewed as having utility due to its ability to damage through walls and ceilings and slowly destroy goo. However, its damage is considered not particularly great, and its utility is considered to be outdone by the thermal board. The user suggests that if its damage was increased or if it was given an extra charge or two, it could potentially be used more often. As it stands, the user places the Cl40 in the C tier.

The go grenade has become a popular option. Its stall potential is seen as very good and can be used to trap enemies in rooms or create new climbing pathways. The user places the go grenade in the A tier.

The explosive mine has seen a decline in use due to nerfs at the beginning of the season. Its preparation and luck requirement is viewed as being more than the frag grenades, and its viability in most circumstances is questionable. The user places this in the C tier.

The gas mine is seen as a decent method for area denial, especially in lower levels of the game. However, its usefulness decreases at higher levels, where teams are more likely to engage in direct combat rather than trying to steal during a fight. The user places the gas mine in the B tier.

It can open or close engagements and Recent changes to the game 'The Finals' have sparked various opinions on weapon balancing and the performance of the cl40. After the 4.2.0 update, some users believe that the RPG has been nerfed, making it less effective in gameplay. However, it's still seen as a crucial gadget in Heavy's Arsenal, providing the team with crucial HP. 

There have also been changes to the motion sensor gadget, which some players find useful in solo queue. However, in a team setting, they feel there are better gadgets available. It's rated as a B-tier gadget, indicating it's decent but situational.

The nerf to explosive mines has led to the rise of pyrro mine, which is now considered the best landmine. Players appreciate its solid damage output and the fact that you start with two.

The C4 gadget, despite multiple nerfs, remains a popular choice for the heavy loadout. It's particularly useful for delaying the cash out remotely, allowing players to maintain their distance. This is considered a must-pick for the heavy class, placing it in the A-tier.

The anti-grab cube gadget is viewed as less useful, only really serving to move cash outs around. It can stall a cash out, but this is easily countered. This gadget is placed in the C-tier.

The barricade gadget has lost its popularity somewhat since the update. The feedback suggests that after the 4.2.0 update, the cl40 weapon in 'The Finals' game is performing decently and is placed in the B tier. Some players find it okay due to its ability to be maneuvered easily in combat situations. However, the update seems to have made other gadgets more popular.

The Goo is becoming a popular choice as it covers more distance and cannot be dematerialized, making it more effective than the cl40. The Jump Pad has remained a popular pick for the medium class due to its utility in providing a free height and escape route to the team. It is regarded as an S tier gadget.

The Zipline gadget is also considered valuable due to its longer range and quick location access, though it's noted that it's easier to shoot people on it. The Glitch Trap is regarded highly as it effectively counters abilities and utilities, making it an A tier gadget.

The Data Reshaper gadget is viewed as potentially useful or useless, depending on the opposing team's composition. Its ability to reshape turrets into harmless objects is humorous to players, but if the enemy team lacks anything to reshape, this gadget becomes less valuable and is placed in B tier.

The Defib is considered the most powerful gadget currently in the game.

The Gateway is described as one of the best pieces of utility, useful for quick cashouts, improving pacing, and enabling long-distance defense of cashouts. It's also useful for advancing on opponents without taking damage. Due to its versatility, it is given an S tier rating. 

The Glitch Grenades are more valuable in higher-level play and can effectively counter gadgets like the defib and Dome Shield, earning them an A tier rating. 

The Stun Gun is seen as useful across all skill levels, although its use varies. In lower-level play, it can reduce target movement speed, while in higher-level play, it can deny specializations and stop a Cash Out. 

The reviewer does not directly discuss the CL40 or its performance after the 4.2.0 update. It's recommended to look for additional reviews specifically discussing this weapon. The opinion on the CL40 weapon in the game 'The Finals' after the 4.2.0 update seems to be quite positive. The user appreciates the gadget for being particularly useful against mes Shield users or heal beam users, and hence, places it at the top of a tier. 

The thermal vision specialization, however, does not fare well in the user's opinion. The user considers it one of the worst specializations in the game due to its limitations, such as not being able to see mines or gas while active. The user suggests that this is a huge oversight and finds the ability to see through smoke and other invisible lights not as useful, especially when there are other gadgets that could be more beneficial to the team. The user hopes for this aspect to be buffed in future updates.

The thermal bore gadget is valued for its versatility as it allows users to make openings in walls, destroy goo, and get rid of gas. This is seen as a major advantage, earning it a placement in the beer tier.

The cl40 is considered a bit niche compared to the sonar grenade. The player finds it horrible to be hit by the cl40 as a light player while it's not as impactful when playing as a mes Shield heavy. However, the cl40 is still seen as a decent pick, and is ranked as a solid B-tier option. 

The sonar grenade, on the other hand, has advantages over the cl40. It can potentially ping more players without needing a direct line of sight. This feature is especially beneficial when fights get chaotic. The sonar grenade is also rated as a B-tier weapon, but the player suggests possibly switching to the cl40 in the final round or for a different play style. 

Overall, the player seems to be balanced in their opinions on the cl40 and the sonar grenade after the 4.2.0 update. Both weapons have their strengths and can be useful depending on the situation and play style. The player encourages others to try out these weapons and adapt based on their own experiences in the game."
